         Welcome to the long-awaited Phrack Inc. Issue 8.  I&#039;m quite sorry for
all of the delays, but it&#039;s time to go back to school and it&#039;s been a hectic
summer.  Unfortunately, over the summer, Fatal Error of 617 died in a
motorcycle accident.  He was the sysop of Metropolis Elite and was around a
while back.  This issue is released in memory of him, regardless of any
personal opinions.

  Sysop/Co-Sysop of: RACS III (TUCBBS), Phreak Advisor: Sherwood Forest II

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tuc started out in the BBS world in July 1980 when he first got his modem, a
Novation Acoustic.  In August of 1981, Connection-80 of Stony Point, his first
bulletin board, was launched into the BBS world.  It started on a TRS-80 Model
I, Epson MX-80 printer, 2 single density disk drives, a Novation Acoustic
modem, and a home built auto-answer module.  At the time, he didn&#039;t even know
what phreaking was, so it was a general public board.  A software switch to
RACS III occurred on January 10, 1982, running until January 10, 1985. The hard
drive arrived a few months ago to build it to the board that it currently is.

Members of the elite world which he has met include King Blotto, Lex Luthor,
Dr. Who, Crimson Death, The Videosmith, Jester Sluggo, The Sprinter, Mark
Tabas, BIOC Agent 003, Agrajag, Telenet Bob, Big Brother, Cheshire Catalyst,
Egyptian Lover, Magnetic Surfer, Paul Muad&#039;Dib, Lord Digital, Sir Knight, 2600
Editor (Emanuelle Goldstein [sp.]), Susan Thunder, Modem Rider, Sharp Razor,
Hertz Tone, The Flying Avocado, and The Ace.

His phreak experience began in March of 1982 through the new board&#039;s software
having a section called &quot;Phreak-80&quot;.  People started calling and paying
attention to it, including one caller by the name of Susan Thunder, which is
how he personally began to phreak.  She lead him around the scene which
included the infamous 8 BBS and to other people such as Larry Kelly.  Some of
the memorable phreak boards he was on included 8 BBS, MOM, OSUNY, The Private
414 Board (as in THE 414&#039;s), Blottoland, The Connection, L.O.D., Plovernet,
Pirate 80, Sherwood Forest I, II, and III, WOPR, IROC, Pirate Trek, Pirate&#039;s
I/O, Datanet, Stalag 13, A.I. Labs, and Hell Phrozen Over.  He gives credit
for his phreak knowledge to Susan Thunder and the people that she put him in
touch with.

Tuc&#039;s work is as a computer and communications security freelance consultant.
He&#039;s done lots of programming in basic for the TRS-80, and assembly language
for the IBM 370.

Tuc does hack and phreak, but with his employer&#039;s consent.  Tuc attends the TAP
meetings in New York occasionally, but in the past he was a regular.  He&#039;s
attended all Phreak-Con&#039;s, he was an assistant editor of the original TAP, and
was a pioneer in the phreak world before blue boxing and Alliance
Teleconferencing was common knowledge.  Besides that, he was the one on West
57th Street labeled &quot;Scott Jeffrey Ellentuch&quot;.  He was hard to find on that
particular program.

Tuc has been involved with various groups in his lifetime including (in the
order that he joined them) The Warelords, The Knights of Shadow, Apple Mafia,
and, at the same time as Apple Mafia, Fargo 4A.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Interests: Telecommunications (modeming, phreaking, hacking), martial arts
           (weaponry), radio controlled cars and airplanes, and video games.

Tuc&#039;s Favorite Things
---------------------

       Women: A quiet evening with the girlfriend.
        Cars: MG-TD Kit Car.
       Foods: Anything vegetarian.
       Music: The Hooters, and any band he worked for.
     Leisure: Having just a &quot;good old time&quot;.

Most Memorable Experiences
--------------------------

Car ride with 8 phreaks in Tuc&#039;s VW Super Beetle at a Phreak Con.
The Fargo 4A stunt (getting all Fargo, N.D. DA&#039;s to go home).

Some People to Mention
----------------------

Susan Thunder (for getting him started)
All those that helped him while he was coming up in the world (too many to
                                                               mention)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tuc is 150% against credit carding.  He thinks that is out and out criminal
activity, something that is totally against the code of ethics of phreaking and
hacking.  He also doesn&#039;t appreciate the fighting between phreaks that occurs
so often in the phreak world today.  He thinks the modern community is
crumbling.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I hope you enjoyed this phile, look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming in
the near future.  And now for the regularly taken poll from all interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  No names mentioned, but yes, a few of
the ones he has met are computer geeks.  Thank you for your time, Tuc.

     The CWC (City-Wide Centrex) feature provides multiple location large
business customers with centrex features, attendant features, and dialing
capabilities that are transparent across geographic locations and are
independent of the configuration of the #1AESS switches providing the service.
Historically, centrex customers have been somewhat limited to the bounds of the
servicing switch. Customers could be built across switches, but with
limitations. Multiple locations could be arranged to share some features in
common only when placed in a centrex complex served by a single switch.
Obviously, for this to be feasible, the locations had to be geographically near
each other. The CWC feature expands the concept of the centrex group by
allowing a multi-located business to function as a single centrex arrangement
called a CWC group. Although each customer location remains a part of its own
switch with its own individual capabilities, it now functions as part of the
CWC group. Selected centrex features that were defined to operate within the
bounds of a serving switch centrex group are now redefined to operate within
the bounds of the CWC group. The outer boundary of the CWC cannot exceed the
boundary of the LATA due to LCCIS constraints.

     The CWC feature provides a comprehensive communications package for a
multiple location centrex customer. Some advantages are:

          o Extension to Extension (Intercom) dialing.

          o Concentration of private facilities access at one location.

          o Elimination of dedicated facilities between locations within the
            CWC group.

          o Transparency of feature operation across switches.

Use of CCIS trunks to replace tie trunks results in the need for fewer total
trunks and trunk groups. Remote access reduces the total number of customer
trunks required and centralizes customer facilities at one location. All
switches need LCCIS so that information can be passed between locations.

==================
=Intercom Dialing=
==================

     Intercom dialing gives the customer the ability to dial extension numbers
(intercom) to other locations. This is done either by dialing the interlocation
intercom number or by a speed call code which contains an interlocation
intercom number. The customer has the option of routing these interlocation
intercom calls via simulated private or public facilities. After determining
the intercom number dialed is in location, the originating office routes the
call to that location. The call is identified in the centrex customer&#039;s digit
interpreter tables as an interlocation intercom call and normal interoffice
call processing determines routing. A decision is made as to whether simulated
facilities are used for routing the call based on the location identification
of the called line. If needed, a simulated facility is seized. This is
determined by a distant line status request on the called line at the end of
dialing. The originating offices sends information to the terminating office
identifying the call as interlocation intercom call. The CWC group and
location identifier of the calling party are also sent. This is done by using
the RCLDN (retrieval of calling line directory number) to transmit this
information. The terminating office recognizes as incoming call as such. If the
two-way simulated private facilities are used, the count on facilities at the
terminating office is incremented. The use of 2 way simulated pricate
facilities for a call is based on the location identifier of the calling line
and whether simulated private facilities were used on the outgoing side.

===========================
=Centrex Attendant Console=
===========================

     The tie trunks are replaced by CCIS trunks, therefore some changes are
required in the use of the attendant console. The changes are as follows:

     o Busy Verification and attendant call through tests are not applicable
       since there will no longer be specific trunks dedicated to the customer.

     o The existing trunk group busy lamps are replaced with busy lamps for the
       simulated facilities between locations.

     The digit interpreter table entry at each remote location contains the
&quot;Dial 0&quot; DN for the attendant. This is done to process interlocation intercom
calls which terminate to the attendant. If the attendant console uses a centrex
data link, the line equipment assigned to the DN should specify the call
indicator lamp to be used. A different DN should be used for each location if
separate call indicator lamps are desired for calls from each location. This
call indicator lamp flashes at the intragroup rate of 120ipm (interruptions per
minute) to indicate interlocation intercom calls.
     The RCLDN primitive is used to transmit information for intercom dialing
between locations. In addition, the RDLS priminitive is used to provide CWC
information to obtain the CWC group and location identifier of the called line.
The originating, incoming, and CCIS incoming registers are used to save
information at both he originating and terminating offices. These registers
include the CWC group, CWC location identifier, a CWC call type, and an
indicator whether simulated facilities were used at the originating.

==========================
=Remote Access to Private=
=       Facilities       =
==========================

     Remote access to private facilities allows the CWC customer to access
physical private trunks and simulated facilities at a single location. This
allows customers to consolidate their private facilities at one location. The
number of trunks required is reduced. Any station can access these facilities
by dialing the same access code as the main location. If a station dials the
access code for a private facility, the call is routed to the main location
using the same facility as an interlocation intercom call. It is then routed
out from the main location. The CWC feature does not allow the customer to use
the ACOF (Attendant Control of facilities) feature from a remote location. The
types of private facilities which are accessible are:

     o Tie Trunks
     o FX (Foreign Exchange)
     o CCSA (Commmon Control switching arrangement)
     o ETS (Electronic Tandem Switching)
     o WATS (Wide Area Telecommunications system)
     o FRS (Flexible Route selection)
     o EEDP (expanded electronic tandem switching dialing plan)

     The CCIS direct signalling messages are used to communicate between the
remote and main locations during the digit collection and analysis of out-going
calls. Once the voice path has been established, a CCIS banded signalling
message transmits the digits collected. A remote access register is used to
store information retrieved during the processing of the signal requests. This
register belongs to the OR (Originating Register) pool at the main location.
     The remote location is responsible for digit collection and transmission
of collected digits. A remote access data CCIS direct signalling message
transmits the digits from the remote to the main location, which returns
instructions for the next action to be performed. The following items are sent
from the remote to the main location:

     o The digits collected.
     o The FRL(facility restriction level) of orig. line.
     o A FRL present indicator
     o A customer changeable speed call indicator.
     o A call forwarding over private facilities indic.
     o An add-on indicator.
     o The CC location identifier of remote location.
     o The remote access register # of the main location.
     o An abandon remote access request indicator.

     The main location analyzes the information transmitted and returns the
next set of instructions to the remote location. The full analysis of a call
may require several direct signalling messages with information saved from the
previous direct signalling messages. This is required to process the current
direct signalling message being saved in the remote register. The information
gathered is used to establish the voice path for the call. Upon receipt of a
direct signalling request, processing is done in accordance with the function
indicated in the remote register. The types are as follows:

     o Translate access code
     o Translate prefix digit
     o &quot;1+&quot; dialing check
     o Check for possible account code
     o Complete account code received
     o 3 digit translation
     o 6 digit translation
     o 10 digit translation
     o Analyze authorization code
     o FRS 3 Digit translation
     o CCSA translation
     o Abandon call

     After processing at the main location is complete, the remote access
register is set up to identify the next type of function. Then, the main
location returns a CCIS remote message to the remote location. The information
returned from the main location is always in the same format and is saved on
the OR.

==========
=Features=
==========

     The CWC group is allowed many features, here is a list of them.


1. Call Forwarding Variable: Users can forward their calls to remote stations
   located in another office by dialing the access code and the intercom
   number of the CWC station.

2. Call Forwarding Busy Line: Provides for the forwarding of calls to any
   interlocation station within the CWC group upon encountering a busy station.

3. Call Forwarding Don&#039;t Answer: Provides for the forwarding of calls that are
   not answered within a predetermined number of ringing cycles.

4. Call Transfer: Allows the station user to transfer any established call to
   any other station within the CWC group with the following constraints.

     o Dropback rules do not permit 2 outgoing trunks to be involved in the
       final 2 party connection. However, 2 outgoing trunks can be involved in
       a 3 way conversation.

     o On interoffice calls involving a fully restricted station, flash
       capability is allowed. However, the controller is not permitted to
       connect the fully-restricted station to any other station, either in
       dropback or a 3 way conversation.

     Cross network call transfer transparency requires that each location be
provided the Call Transfer-Individual or Call Transfer-Individual-All calls
feature. The CTO (call transfer outside) option may be provided.

5. Call Waiting feature provides a burst of tone when the called party is busy
on another call. The types of Call Waiting features and CWC interactions are:

     o Call Waiting Originating: allows a CWC calling station to direct a call
       waiting tone toward a busy station within the same CWC group.

     o Call Waiting Intragroup: gives call waiting tone to a called party
       which has call waiting terminating on all intragroup calls.

     o Dial Call Waiting: Allows originating CWC station users to invoke call
       waiting on CWC intragroup calls by dialing an access code followed by
       the extension number of the station to be call waited.

6. Distinctive Ringing/CW Tone: Allows a CWC station user to determine the
source of a call incoming to the station. This is done by associating a
distinctive ringing or tone pattern with the incoming call based on its source.
Interlocation CWC calls receive intragroup treatment.

7. Message Desk Service: Provides centralized and personalized call coverage or
message answering capabilities which can serve the needs of all CWC locations.
The Call Forwarding Variable and Call Forwarding Busy Line/Don&#039;t Answer feature
are needed of forwarding calls from stations within the CWC group.

8. LASS (Local Area Signalling Service): Provides the called party with call
management and security services. Local CCIS is required for multiple-office
grouping within a LATA for intercom calls. The following features comprise the
LASS offering :

     o Automatic Recall: Enables a station user to place a call to the LCDN
       (Last Call Directory Number) currently associated with the users fone.
       The LCDN can either be the last party called by the station user or the
       last party to call the station user.

     o Distinctive Alerting: Allows the station user to prespecify a set of
       numbers which activate a distinctive ring or distinctive call waiting
       tone. The CWC extension numbers can be entered on the screen list. When
       the user receives a call from one of these numbers, the phone if idle,
       will ring with a special distinctive ringing pattern. If a call waiting
       customer&#039;s line is busy, a special tone notifies the customer of the
       impending call.

     o ICLID: provides the number which is calling the station user. (Explained
       in other files)

     o Selective Call Forwarding: (Explained in other file)

     o Selective Call Rejection: Provides the user with the capability of not
       being alerted by calls from a specified set of numbers. The user inputs
       the numbers to be rejected from the station set. These numbers are
       specified either directly (dialed in) or as the number of the last call
       received. The CWC extensions are allowed on the screen list.

                    Volume One, Issue Eight, Phile #4 of 9

                    The Integrated Services Digital Network

                           ---==&gt; By Dr. Doom &lt;==---

  ISDN or Integrated Services Digital Network has been talked about off and on
by AT&amp;T and until now has just been a demented AT&amp;T fantasy, but it is to soon
become a reality.  This phile is the second I have written on the subject and
is a cumulation of information from three basic sources :

&lt;1&gt; The ISDN AT&amp;T Technical Journal
&lt;2&gt; An interview with an AT&amp;T Long Distance Operations Center Supervisor who
    will be referred to as Mr. R.
&lt;3&gt; and some general ISDN articles from Southwestern Bell Newsletters.


ISDN Definition
===============

CCITT Definition : An end to end digital network that supports a wide range of
services accessed by a set of standard multipurpose user-network interfaces.

  ISDN will allow for incredible new services that will drastically change the
telecommunications industry and everyone&#039;s lives.  For example, one new service
ISDN will bring about is calling party identification.  This will allow
businesses and individuals who subscribe to that service to know exactly what
number you are calling from before they even decide whether or not to answer
the phone.

In the case of dialups like MCI, the originating # will be stored in a computer
along with whatever code and number that person dialed which would greatly
hinder abuse of codes from a home phone.

  This is just the tip of the iceberg as far as ISDN is concerned.  This phile
will analyze and describe how The Integrated Services Digital Network will
operate when it is implemented.


Out of Band Signalling
======================

  Essential to a network capable of providing such enhanced services as calling
party identification is out-of-band signalling.  Until the late 70&#039;s, when AT&amp;T
introduced the 4ESS toll switch and CCIS into the national network, switches
had communicated with each other over the same channels in which our voice or
data was transmitted (in-band).  During this time, all signalling between
switches had to be limited to a type that could be accommodated in the &#039;voice&#039;
channel thus making it impossible to offer any advanced services.

  The development of the separate Common Channel Interoffice Signaling (CCIS)
network allowed for more freedom and flexibility and thus came about the AT&amp;T
Calling Card service.

  ISDN brings an interface from the network to the subscriber&#039;s equipment. This
is a completely digital interface subdivided into two types of channels :

The &#039;D&#039; Channels are those used for sending signalling and control information
across the interface. The &#039;B&#039; Channels are those used only for customer
information which can be in the form of voice, data, or video.

The &#039;D&#039; Channel hence manages the information or &#039;B&#039; Channels making the
signalling &#039;out-of-band&#039; and not &#039;in-band&#039; as it is now.  This approach allows
for two distinct benefits :

&lt;1&gt; All the capacity in the information bearing channels is available for
    customer use.
&lt;2&gt; The &#039;D&#039; Signaling channel allows for distributed processing across the ISDN
    Network.

ISDN Interfaces
---------------

  The CCITT has defined two major interfaces that will be used in conjunction
with the &#039;D&#039; and &#039;B&#039; channels :

The Basic Rate Interface (BRI) consists of one D Channel and two B Channels.
This interface is used for locations where information transport is relatively
small like a residence.

The Primary Rate Interface (PRI) consists of one &#039;D&#039; Channel and 23 &#039;B&#039;
Channels.  It is used for large capacity vehicles such as PBX&#039;s.

Notice that there are 2 DIFFERENT &#039;B&#039; Channels in the Basic Rate Interface.
This allows TWO different types of data to be sent over the same connection at
the same time.  For example, you could be ULing files to a board on Channel 1
while talking to the SYSOP on Channel 2.

So, if both you and a board both have a BRI ISDN Interface, next time the SYSOP
says &#039;Go Voice&#039;, you simply pick up the handset, switch it to channel 2, and
start talking...

These multiple channels are also the foundation for the widespread use of Video
Phones.  Just like you were sending data over channel 1, and talking voice on
channel 2, you can be sending video over channel 1 (allowing the party&#039;s to see
each other) and talking on channel 2.

ISDN Devices
============

  AT&amp;T Technologies, Advanced Micro Devices, and Intel are all in the process
of designing equipment that will be compatible with ISDN.  So far, the two main
designs talked about through SWB and AT&amp;T are :

&lt;1&gt; The Voice/Data Terminal This will look like any regular computer terminal
   with the exception that it has a handset on the side of the terminal and a
   couple of switches that will allow you to decide which channel is for DATA
   and which channel is for VOICE. This will also (of course), allow two
   customers with a V/D Terminal to be exchanging DATA over one channel while
   talking voice over the other one.

&lt;2&gt; The Video Phone
   This is where (yes) Big Brother is arriving...  The Video Phone will work
   pretty much just like it does in Science Fiction movies like &#039;Aliens&#039; or
   whatever. If two ISDN customers have video phones, they can talk and see
   each other or whatever they want to show each other (HAHA) at the same time.
   Video Phones obviously open up new frontiers for those with entrepreneurial
   instincts.  You can bet there will be some interesting Video Phone Sex lines
   around... Then, you can have things like &#039;Dial a Movie...Please enter (1) to
   view Rambo&#039;..etc... The list goes on.  This also leads to a whole new world
   of problems for the telephone company like &#039;Obscene Video Calls&#039;.  This is
   again where Calling ID becomes important.

Each of these units, and others that will work with ISDN will have some sort of
a special viewing screen that will contain the necessary information about
incoming calls which includes the originating number and can include such
things as :

&lt;1&gt; The name of the owner of that #
&lt;2&gt; The city and state
&lt;3&gt; The whole address for that #


AT&amp;T ISDN Building Blocks
=========================

  AT&amp;T has designated certain &#039;building blocks&#039; that will eventually be laid in
place across the entire country to form ISDN.


&lt;1&gt; AT&amp;T Communications Service Node
------------------------------------
  The service node is the customer&#039;s gateway to the AT&amp;T Communications nodal
family of services, including MEGACOM, MEGACOM 800, and Acunet. The first
service node went into service in 1985 in Philadelphia, PA.

&lt;2&gt; Integrated Access
---------------------
  This allows customers to integrate switched and private line services over a
single DS-1 link to the Service Node.

&lt;3&gt; Out-of-Band Signaling
-------------------------
  Discussed earlier.

&lt;4&gt; CCS7
--------
  The CCS7 Common Channel Signaling Network will soon replace CCIS as an
out-of-band signalling between AT&amp;T Network Communications Facilities. Because
of its longer message format and layered structure, the CCS7 will support the
new features.

&lt;5&gt; Digital Backbone Network
----------------------------
  This nationwide AT&amp;T Network includes extensive lightwave and digital radio
routes.  By the end of 1988, these Digital Lightwave routes will extend to
Europe with the TAT-8 lightwave system, and across the Pacific with
HAW-4/TPC-3.

&lt;6&gt; Intelligent Software Controlled
    AT&amp;T Communications Network
-----------------------------------
  This brings about more advanced software related services listed in #1.


AT&amp;T ISDN Operations
====================


Access Transport
----------------
  Your DS-1 signal is transported from your ISDN equipment to an AT&amp;T
Communications Service Node somewhere.
  Your line gets to AT&amp;T by tariff from the local exchange carrier (i.e...
Southwestern Bell, GTE, or whomever happens to own your local switch...) or
AT&amp;T.  The direct link to the AT&amp;T Service Node bypasses your local switching.

AT&amp;T Service Node
-----------------
  Your local AT&amp;T Service Node is a service office that acts as a gateway to
all the new AT&amp;T Nodal ISDN services.  This service node is typically composed
of :

&lt;1&gt; A Refinished 4ESS Switch
&lt;2&gt; CNI Ring (Common Net.-Interface)
&lt;3&gt; Digital Access and Cross Connect System (DACS)

Here is a diagram of how a customer location either goes to a local switch or
AT&amp;T&#039;s node :

                                       Node


  The above diagram shows first how an AT&amp;T Customer with ISDN can either
continue service with his local telephone co. or go with a direct link to the
AT&amp;T Service Mode.  All lines going to an AT&amp;T Service Node whether through
Bell or a direct link terminate on either the 4ESS or the DACS.
  When a line terminates on a DACS it serves as an Integrated Access
Distributor and sends the call to the 1PSS (Packet Switch) for Acunet Packet
Service or to the 4ESS and then eventually out to the AT&amp;T Network.

The AT&amp;T Internodal Network
---------------------------
  In the internodal network facility, AT&amp;T is in the process of deploying both
digital lightwave and digital radio systems.

Lightguide Systems :

  In areas where growth is low, the FT3C and FTX180 Single mode terrestrial
lightguide systems will be used between nodes.

  On high growth routes AT&amp;T will install fiber pairs at line rates of 1.7Gb/s
with 20 mile repeater spacings.

Digital Radio :

  In the digital radio area, 4Gb/s systems such as the TD-90 and the TD-180
provide a vehicle for rapid expansion of digital connectivity.


ISDN and Digital Switches
=========================

  AT&amp;T has redesigned the 5E Switching Modules in such a way that they are
fully compatible with ISDN, but many of the existing 5E&#039;s and other switches
were manufactured without ISDN capability.  To meet this need, AT&amp;T has
produced ISDN interfaces that modularly connect to the system. Here is a
diagram of a 5ESS Switching Module with interfaces :

                     $====--------------------------


The two new hardware additions are :

&lt;1&gt; Integrated Services Line Unit and

&lt;2&gt; The Packet Switch Interface Unit

  These units allow a LOCAL 5ESS (or other digital) Switch to serve both ISDN
and non-ISDN customers. These interfaces are integrated into a switching module
in a way that will allow ISDN customers to maintain all their previous Bell
services like Local Calling.  Notice also that all lines, whether ISDN or not,
terminate on the ISLU.

Calling Party Identification
============================

  Discussed briefly in the preface of this phile, the ISDN enhanced Calling
Party Identification service offered by AT&amp;T ISDN will be into service along
with the ISDN.
  This quote out of the AT&amp;T ISDN Technical reference should give you a good
idea of the impact ISDN will have on hacking and phreaking :

  &#039;One example of an enhanced service which has already been included in the
   ISDN signaling protocol and will have a fundamental impact on day to day
   telecommunications is the provisions of calling party identification.
   Calling party ID will help us decide whether or not to answer incoming calls
   and will minimize instances of nuisance calls and COMPUTER FRAUD via
   telephone.&#039;

  Mr. R, our AT&amp;T Supervisor has been attending ISDN Conferences that include
representatives from all the major LD Companies (AT&amp;T, MCI, GTE, LDS, etc..),
the Regional Bells, and other concerned parties.  He said quote &#039;One of the
controlling factors behind The Integrated Services Digital Network is the
simple fact that AT&amp;T, MCI, and other long distance companies are losing
MILLIONS to Phone Phraud.&#039;  Once ISDN is realized, so will network wide Calling
Party Identification.
  Again, our friend Mr. R will enlighten us on the subject of ISDN Calling
Party ID and a simple explanation of how it will work :

  &#039;Right now, when you pick up the phone in your home, Port Isabel South
   Western Bell knows that you did.  Then, when you dial a number, they know
   what number you dialed. So they send that information along to us (the AT&amp;T
   Toll Switch).  We then send that along through the network to the person you
   are calling.&#039;

Of course, there is one transaction between AT&amp;T and a Bell Office at the end
that he left off, but if the person or computer you are calling has ISDN
Calling Party ID service, your originating # will be sent along the DS-1 Line
Interface from Bell to his equipment and show up on his screen after traveling
through the network like Mr. R described.

This is rather simple when you think about it and is one example of how a once
shattered network is working together.

Some Sample CP ID Uses
----------------------
This can be used by large telephone ordering companies to instantly display a
record of that persons credit, previous orders, etc... before the call is even
answered on the attendant&#039;s terminal.

When someone logs onto a computer, the originating # is listed on the user log
along with the account name, etc... so that if there is an unauthorized login,
they can contact the authorities to do whatever or monitor that number until
they get enough evidence to prosecute.  The same thing holds true with LD
Dialups.  They will record the originating number along with the code and bill
making MCI use rather dangerous.


SWB ISDN News
=============

  The following article was extracted from The Southwestern Bell Texas
Publication of Telephone Times and is entitled &#039;User Forum simplifies ISDN&#039; :

&quot; Houston---Houston Marketing employees played show and tell with two customers
and all three groups are better off for it.
  Marketing Representatives, with support from Bell Comm. Research, Illinois
Bell, AT&amp;T, and McDonald&#039;s Corp. met with Shell and Tenneco to discuss ISDN.
  &#039;ISDN is an evolving technology&#039; said Bob Campbell, division manager
marketing business sales.  &#039;It&#039;s still in the developmental stage.  These User
Forums will give customers input on how it&#039;s deployed and what it will look
like.&#039;
  ISDN is an all digital network that transmits voice and data messages
simultaneously over a single telephone line.
  &#039;The User Forums allow customers to share information on specific problems
concerning implementation, training, customer premise equipment and
applications,&#039; Campbell said.
  Linda Hobson, manager marketing administrative and coordinator of the event,
said not only will User Forums be standard practice in Houston, but probably
will become the national standard.
  &#039;We&#039;re doing it quarterly here, but as more people become interested, we may
meet more often,&#039; Hobson said.
  Shell and Tenneco, who have signed letters of intent to purchase ISDN, were
specifically interested in such topics as trial status (SWBT&#039;s ISDN trials will
begin soon in St. Louis and Texas), available features, power requirements, and
future enhancements.
  &#039;In the past, we bought the available enhancements, then sold them to the
customer,&#039; said Hobson.  &#039;That&#039;s changing.  We have to find out what the
customer wants, then deliver the service that meets the specific needs&#039;&quot;

  That concludes the nice little article which by the way, contained some
interesting little tidbits of information.


Conclusion
==========

  ISDN is a VERY complicated plan that will drastically change the
telecommunications scene in this country and abroad.  Although AT&amp;T has boasted
in it&#039;s Technical Journals of being able to have its ISDN Capable Network
completed by Early 1987, this date seems to keep getting postponed back
according to our friend Mr. R (The AT&amp;T Supervisor) and he is shooting for
large scale ISDN no earlier that late 1988 or 1989.  Whenever ISDN does become
reality, people will probably just put out files with lists of computers that
subscribe to ISDN Calling Party Identification, and tell people not to call
them from their home.

  I hope you have enjoyed reading this phile on ISDN, I will be on the outlook
for more information on it.

If you don&#039;t already have the # and New User Passwords to Metromedia BBS, send
me (Dr. Doom) mail on any of the boards I am on.

  **********************************************************************

        This file will detail the use of a rural junction box to fraud the
phone company and make all the free phone calls you want to BBS or AE by.

        There are two basic types of rural junction boxes: Residential and
Group boxes.  I will first discuss Residential as they are easier to find
and easier to use.  There are a couple of requirements before you can make
full use of a Junction Box.  First you must have some kind of portable
computer with a built-in modem or at least a hand phone if all you want to
do is make free calls to your friends.  For computer I would recommend
something like a Model 100 from Radio Shack.  Small, inexpensive but only
300 baud and only 32K of total storage.

        Anyway you can find residential junction boxes in most any rural area
just a few feet off the road and usually covered over with local weeds.  Fish
your way thru the weeds and open it up.  Some just open with a twist or a
turn, others are actually locked and require a little more patience.  Anyway
once you have it open, you should see at least 4 pairs (possibly more) of
wires.  You are only concerned with the pair containing both a red and a green
wire.

        Now you need to make a choice:  Do you want to totally cut off the
regular owners of the phone line and do actual damage to this junction box or
leave them connected but have the possibility of them picking up their phone
and hearing your carrier?

        Usually you will want to cut them out totally, so simply find a bit of
slack in the line and cut both wires.  Now in most boxes the connection to the
outside world comes from the bottom of the box, but sometimes you will find
one that doesn&#039;t conform.  Simply attach a hand phone to the wires (matching
up colors, of course) and see if you get a dial tone.  Anyway once you have
the proper pair then hook up to your modem line and dial anyway.  Meanwhile
the lawful owners of the line will get a dead line on their end, so try to
do this only when you think no one would be using the phone, like 11PM to 7AM
or else they will probably call their LOC and tell them to fix the line and
when they see the cut wires, they will wonder what went on there.  Finally be
a good guy and when you are done, resplice the wires together and shut the
box.

        Now usually you don&#039;t want to cause permanent damage to the box, so
simply strip off the insulation on the line and attach the red and green ends
of your modem cord to them.  Now when you cut in, it will be much like an
extension was picked up.  Simply dial away and have fun.  Of course if anyone
at the house picks up the line they will get your carrier and will wonder, so
try to limit your activities also to the same hours mentioned above, unless you
know who you are ripping off and when they use the phone.  The advantages of
this method is that once you strip the wires, there is little work to do each
time you use the box again.

        Now what do you do if you are lucky enough to find a Group box?  Well
first you are confronted with a multitude of wires, anywhere from 10 pairs up
to 100 if you use a box on the edge of a small town.  Finding a pair of the
right wires is a little more difficult unless your LOC has done repairs at
this box in the last couple of months, in which case a lot of the wires will
already be paired off.  If you aren&#039;t so lucky find a couple of wires and try
them out.  Once again you have the choice of stripping or cutting the wires,
but the advantage here is that you can use this box for about 4-6 months
without having to find a new one.

        What is the this junk about having to find a new box?  Well you see
when you use a junction box in this manner, you are basically adding an
illegal extension to a private line.  Any calls you make will show up on the
rightful owners bill.  If you are only using the box for one or two short to
medium length calls a week, then you might not have any problems.  However if
you use a box too much and the people keep calling the billing office about
the extra calls, the billing office will call those numbers and hear the
carrier.  This will tip them off to the fact that someone is either lying at
the rightful owner&#039;s house or that someone has tapped into their phone line.
At this present time in the Midwest, it take about 2-3 months for the LOC to
realize that someone is playing with their junction box.  What they do is come
out and repair the wires and usually put a newer lockable box on the site to
discourage illegal use.  I haven&#039;t yet really pushed the LOC to any limits
yet, but one might suspect that has Junction boxing catches on to those of us
who have access to laptop computers, the LOC may find some way of catching us
at our little game.

        If anyone has any new information on how your LOC is handling this use
of their junction boxes please let us know by leaving mail for Thomas Covenant
on any Metal Shop board.

        [Postscriptum note by Thomas Covenant: I&#039;d recommend one of those so-
called &quot;portable&quot; AT-compatibles.  Great clock speed, 1200 baud, and a bigger
screen.  And why not pack a picnic lunch and some booze?  You&#039;ll be there all
day once you get started!]

  Since its rather humble beginnings in Dublin, Ohio some years ago,
Compuserve, or CIS, as it will be referred to in this article, has grown to
become the largest entertainment/public user oriented system in the country.
This file is divided into two parts.  The first is how to get your own CIS ID
number, and make it last a relatively long time.  This part may seem like old
hat to some of you out there.  The second part is information on what to do
once you are on the system...tricks and tips to keep you out of trouble, or
cause trouble.
  A Compuserve identification number is divided into two parts; a project
number and a programmer number.  An example would be 70007,1460.  This ID is
what you will be known by at all times on the system.  When you log on, you
will also be prompted for a password, in addition to your user ID.  The
password is divided into two words, kept apart by a separator  (-,:,.,etc). The
password may be any two words the user desires, including garbage, which makes
gaining an ID by hacking the password almost, if not totally, impossible.
  The most popular, and about the only way left, of gaining an ID is by buying
what the system calls a snapak.  These are the little goodies you see in the
store in the introductory packets.  With this, you can gain access to most, but
not all of the system.
  The first ID, or the &quot;intro&quot; ID will last about a week, at which time,
Compuserve automatically changes the password, and sends the new one to you via
the US Postal service.  This is a key point to the ID scam.  You MUST have
valid Credit Card information to be able to continue using the ID.  I have
heard of intro IDs going bad in a matter of 2 or 3 days due to having non-valid
credit card info.  So you need to set up a location to which your second
password can be mailed.  This second password should last about a month,
depending on how much credit the CC holder has on his card.
  When applying credit to a Visa or Mastercard, Compuserve will submit the
charges about once a week.  If you run up about $500 in connect charges, and
the credit card cannot hold it, the ID will go bad.  This is the most common
way for an account to run out.
  Your first password has some limits.  Due to hackers using snapaks,
Compuserve has installed a system which prohibits IDs without the second
password from entering any type of game online.  This ranges from the
ever-popular MegaWars, to YGI, all the way down to Casino.  This is one reason
why the second password is so important.
  If more than one person will be using the account, which is usually the case,
there are also some limits to be observed.  The same ID can no longer enter the
CB simulator more than once.  If it is tried, the message &quot;exceeding job limit&quot;
will occur, and you will be taken back to the prior menu.  The same ID can go
into a SIG at the same time, but both people cannot enter COnference mode while
on the SIG.  The best way to talk to another user who is on the same ID is to
go into any forum, say CBMART, and have one of them enter COnference mode.
There, the two users can use the /SEN command to relay messages between the SIG
and COnference.  This is kind of complicated, but it is the only way.  Also,
anytime the message &quot;exceeding job limit&quot; goes to your screen, the people at
CIS put a small &quot;red mark&quot; by your name.  If it occurs too frequently, they
look into the situation to find out if more than one person may be using the
same ID.
  Special IDs -- Ok, now that you are on Compuserve, what should you look out
for? As mentioned before, the user ID is divided into [project
number,programmer number] format.  The Programmer number is of no importance,
but the Project number is.  Some of the ones you should be aware of while
online are:

  70000,xxxx  Compuserve Security
  70003,xxxx  Compuserve Employee
  70004,xxxx  Same as above
  70005,xxxx  Radio Shack demo account
  70006,xxxx  Customer service, or &quot;Wizard&quot; number (see below)
  70007,xxxx  Complimentary account
  76703,xxxx  SIG SysOp, or Forum Info Provider

  While on CB, look out for the 70000 IDs, and especially the 70006, or
&quot;wizard&quot; numbers.  The Wizard ids have some very special functions.  The main
one is called autogag, or /GAG.  This allows the bearer of this ID to banish
any user from the system, in a way.  What it actually does is to keep the
/GAGged person out of everyone&#039;s view.  They will not show up on the /ust list,
and anything they type will not show up on anybody else&#039;s screen.  Kind of like
a mute button on a television.  The Chief of CIS security is Dan Pisker, and on
CB he uses the handles &quot;Dan&#039;l&quot;, or &quot;Ghost&quot;, with a 70000 id.
  Monitoring -- This is a very popular subject with the users of Compuserve,
but when broken down, it is quite simple.  CIS is capable of monitoring
ANYTHING that is said on the system.  This doesn&#039;t mean that they do, however.
For /TALK to be monitored in a Forum or on CB, CIS must first have a court
order...it is supposedly as illegal as tapping a phone line.  This has been
done before to catch some major hackers on the system.  /SEN in a SIG is not
supposedly monitorable....the status on it is the same as on /TALK.  /SCR mode
on CB or on a SIG is definitely monitorable, especially if the the /SCR key is
typed on open channel.  Keep /SCR conversations to a minimum.  As far as
anything else goes, anything said on open channel is quite definitely seen by
SOMEBODY in the big chair up in Ohio.  It would not surprise me at all if they
hire people to go through CB Transcripts every day to look for that kind of
thing.  Also, when you are in COnference mode in a SIG, always check the
/STAtus of the channel.  If /STA EVER returns that there are more people on the
channel you are on than the /USERS function does, then you can rest assured
that the channel is being monitored.
  Nodes -- When you log on through CIS, you are going through a node.  The node
takes the form of 3 letters, designating the site of the computer through which
you are connecting through Compuserve.  An example would be &quot;NYJ&quot; (New York
City).  There are some special nodes you should know about, though.
  Tymnet - Anybody logging on through Tymnet will be assigned one of these
nodes - QAI, QAJ, QAK, QAC, QAM, QAN, QAO, QCA, QCB, QCC, QCE, QCF, QCH.  This
cannot identify where you are calling from, just that you are logging in
through the Tymnet network.
  Telenet - QBA, QBC, QBD, QBG, QBF, QEN, QEI, QEP.
   Also, another special node would be DB- (DBA, DBB, DBC, etc), which means
that the user is logging on from Compuserve&#039;s Headquarters in Dublin.
   The way to tell what node somebody is in is by typing /UST on either CO mode
on a SIG, or CB...the result is like this....
   Job   User Id   Ch.  Node  Handle
   ---  ---------- ---  ----  ------
1)  12  70003,1295  17  CSG   Red Leather
2) 133  70006,1293  1s  BAF   Surf&#039;s Up!
3)  69  76703,1211 Tlk  BOO   JOE CUFFS
4)  22  70000,1959  30* DBA   Pig
  Now, you can tell something specific about each of these four people based on
the info given above.  Red is in Columbus, Ohio, and is on Channel 17.  She is
also a Compuserve Employee.  Surf is in Bakersfield, California, and is a
Customer service personnel.  He is also using /SCRamble.  Joe is in Talk, is a
sysop on a SIG, and is in Boston, Massachusetts.  This is the format for Talk
on CB.  Pig is on talk in a SIG, and is a security personnel from Dublin, Ohio.
 The format for showing if somebody is in /Talk is different on a SIG than in
regular CB.  Also, the /SEN command is not implemented on CB.
  Have fun with this...hope it helps.  Distribute the file however you want,
but make sure the credits stay at the bottom.

                    Volume One, Issue Eight, Phile #7 of 9

                          Fun with Automatic Tellers
                                      by
                               +++The Mentor+++

        Preface:  This is not a particularly easy scam to pull off, as it
requires either advanced hacking techniques (TRW or banks) or serious balls
(trashing a private residence or outright breaking &amp; entering), but it can
be well worth your while to the tune of $500 (five hundred) a day.
        Laws that will be broken:  Credit Fraud, Wire Fraud, Bank Fraud, Mail
Fraud, Theft Over $200, Forgery, and possibly a few others in the course of
setting the scheme up (rape and murder are optional, but recommended.)
        This all grew from an idea that Poltergeist had about a year ago be-
fore he turned fed on Extasyy, and Cisban Evil Priest (Android Pope) and my-
self were implementing it with great success before our untimely arrest and
recruitment into the service of the State.  It is risky, but no more so than
some of the more elaborate carding routines floating around.
        The first step is to target your victim.  The type person you are
looking for is rich.  Very rich.
        Now, don&#039;t go trying to hit on J.P. Getty or Johnny Carson or some-
one who carries a high name recognition.  This will just get you into trouble
as everyone notices a famous person&#039;s name floating across their desk.
        Instead look for someone who owns a chain of hog feed stores or some-
thing discreet like that.  We targeted a gentleman who is quite active in the
silver market, owning several mines in South Africa and not wanting this to
be widely known (he had no desire to be picketed.)
        Next step, take out a p.o. box in this person&#039;s name.  Extasyy wrote
a good file on obtaining a box under a fake name, I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s still
around.  If not, there are several others out there.  (Yeah, I know, this has
already weeded out the weak of spirit.  Anyone who has gotten this far without
panic is probably going to get away with it.)
        Now comes the fun part, requiring some recon on your part.  You need
to know some fairly serious details about this person&#039;s bank dealings.
        1)  Find out what bank he deals with mainly.  This isn&#039;t too dif-
            ficult, as a quick run through his office trash will usually let
            you find deposit carbons, withdrawal receipts, or *anything* that
            has the bank name on it.
        2)  Find out the account number(s) that he has at the bank.  This can
            usually be found on the above-mentioned receipts.  If not, you can
            get them in TRW (easier said than done) or you can con them out of
            a hassled bank teller over the phone (Use your imagination.  Talk
            slowly and understandingly and give plausible excuses [&quot;I work for
            his car dealership, we need to do a transfer into his account&quot;].)
        2a) [optional]  If you can, find out if he has an ATM (Automatic
            Teller) card.  You don&#039;t need to know numbers or anything, just
            if a card exists.  This can also be ascertained over the phone
            if you cajole properly.
        3)  Armed with this information, go into action.
                a) Obtain some nice (ivory quality) stationary.  It doesn&#039;t
                   have to be engraved or anything, but a $5 or $10 invest-
                   ment to put a letterhead with his initials or something
                   on it couldn&#039;t hurt.  But the most important thing is that
                   it look good.
                b) Type a nice letter to the bank notifying them of your
                   address change.  Some banks have forms you have to fill out
                   for that sort of thing, so you need to check with the bank
                   first (anonymously, of course).  You will have to have a
                   good copy of his signature on hand to sign all forms and
                   letters (again, trash his office).
                c) Call the bank to verify the new address.
                d) IMMEDIATELY upon verifying the change of address, send a
                   second letter.  If he already has an ATM card, request a
                   second card with the business name engraved in it be sent
                   for company use.  If he doesn&#039;t have an ATM card, the let-
                   ter should request one for account number xxxxxx.  Ask for
                   two cards, one with the wife&#039;s name, to add authenticity.
                e) Go to the bank and ask for a list of all ATM&#039;s on the
                   bank&#039;s network.  Often the state has laws requiring *all*
                   machines take *all* cards, so you&#039;ll probably be in good
                   shape.
                f) Await the arrival of your new card.  The PIN (personal
                   identification number) is included when they send out a
                   card.  After picking up the card, forget that you ever
                   even *knew* where the p.o. box was, and make sure you
                   didn&#039;t leave fingerprints.
                g) Begin making the maximum daily withdrawal on the card
                   (in most cases $500/day), using a different machine
                   each time.  Since many of these machines have cameras
                   on them, wear a hat &amp; jacket, or a ski mask to be really
                   paranoid.  To cut the number of trips you have to make
                   in half, be at an ATM a few minutes before midnight.  Make
                   one $500 withdrawal right before midnight, and another one
                   right after.  This cuts down on the number of trips, but
                   police or bank officials may spot the pattern and start
                   watching machines around midnight.  Use your own judgement.
       Conclusion: Before using the card, make sure that all fingerprints are
wiped from it.  Usually the first hint you will have that they have caught on
to your scam is that the machine will keep the card.  Also, avoid using mach-
ines in your own town unless it is a big city (Chicago, Milwaukee, Dallas,
etc...).

        Well, I hope this file has proved interesting.  Of course, it is only
intended for entertainment, and I heartily discourage anyone from even *think-
ing* about trying such a thing.  Jail isn&#039;t fun, as I can testify.  So I take
no responsibility for the misapplication of this information.
        (But if someone else pulls it off, I wouldn&#039;t be averse to hearing
about it...)

On The Home Front
-----------------
Well lots of things have been happening around here in the past few weeks.
For starters, I received a call from Ralph Meola.  Apparently someone had left
his secretary with a message that I had called.  Prior to this, someone named
Steve had left a message as well which Ralph had assumed was Slave Driver.   He
called Steve first, mainly to discuss the letter that was sent to him via PWN
issue V.  Well eventually he got around to calling me.  Not too much was said,
but he wanted to clear up some misconceptions about his encounter with Sigmund
Fraud.  Meola claims that he never threatened Sigmund Fraud about getting his
account to Stronghold East.   Futhermore, he claims only to have called him
because SF had posted several AT&amp;T Calling Cards on an unnamed west coast bbs.
Sigmund Fraud still publicly claims that what he said originally was true,
but privately admitted that he was lying.

Some other developments would include an imposter of myself who is running
around on bulletin boards.  Two of the boards that he is on include Elite
Connection (303) and Green Galaxy (714).  I have never called these boards and
I advise the sysops to remove &quot;my&quot; accounts as this is not me.

On the lighter side, Metal Shop Private now has 20 Megs of online storage.  The
G-phile library has been re-installed including most of the files from Metal
Shop AE and Metal Shop Private is once again the official Phrack distribution
center.

Metal Shop AE is down for the time being because Cheap Shades has left for
college, but he has since brought forth a new system known as the Quick Shop.
All former MS AE members have been entered into QS&#039;s bbs log.  Metal Shop
Brewery has lost its modem and its hard drive is fried, so it will be gone for
a while.

Boston Busts                                                     August 9, 1986
------------
A couple of weeks prior to the above date, Dr. Who came to visit Recent Change
and The Clashmaster. Well, he apparently had cashed roughly 16 checks belonging
to one John Martino (a man who lives down the street from him).  Around August
4, 1986, Dr. Who and Telenet Bob were picked up in a store in North Adams,
Massachusetts.  They were trying to pass off another check.

The police were on the scene very shortly and they were taken in.  Dr. Who told
the police inspector about a PDP-11/23 when asked about it.  He had frauded
this at Harvard University and told them that RC Modeler (also known as Recent
Change) had it.  They converged on a sleeping RC who confessed everything.

Dr. Who is being charged with 16 counts of theft.
RC Modeler is being charged with larceny &amp; possibly as an accomplice to theft.
Telenet Bob is being charged with 1 count of attempted theft.

Dr. Who and RC Modeler are reportedly out of the scene permanently and Dr. Who
may be serving some prison time.  Also, RC Modeler, when being questioned, was
asked about Legion of Doom.  This is VERY strange since we cannot figure out
quite WHY this was asked.

Sysops are asked to clear their accounts form any bbs they were on.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is the interpretation of the same events as described by the
Concord Journal.  The real names of the phreaks involved have been censored.

Computer Theft Charge
---------------------
An 18-year-old Concord man was charged on August 5, 1986 with stealing a $3,300
computer [PDP-11/23 with Venix software] from Harvard University and a portable
stereo from an unknown store by using checks, police allege he knew to be
forged, to pay for the items, police said.

RC Modeler, was charged with two counts of larceny over $100, police said.
[Also, accessory to the crime, RC says.]

Police issued a warrant for RC&#039;s arrest after being tipped-off by the North
Adam&#039;s police that he had allegedly made purchases with checks they alleged to
be stolen and forged.

North Adam&#039;s police, according to reports, arrested Doctor Who, of Lenox, MA.
[and Telenet Bob], and charged him with using stolen and forged checks earlier
this month.  Police said Who told them about RC&#039;s purchases.  They said Who
wrote checks for the purchase of the computer equipment and the stereo for RC.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Well, RC might get off with 3 years of probation (including possible drug
testing according to RC.).  Dr. Who&#039;s court set is set for August 25, 1986.
He will most likely be doing some prison time unfortunately.  Please address
all further questions to The Clashmaster.

Portrait Of The Typical Computer Criminal                       August 11, 1986
-----------------------------------------
from PC Week Magazine

In studying the typical computer criminal, the National Center for Computer
Crime Data, in L.A., may have recently shattered some common myths.

Rather than being some genius computer programmer, according to the center&#039;s
recently published report, the typical computer criminal is just that: quite
typical. He&#039;s most often a male, with an average age of 22, and if not, he&#039;s
next likely to be 19. Chances are he&#039;s a programmer, but if that job
description doesn&#039;t fit, he&#039;s most likely a student or an input clerk.

Less than 5% of the time, this criminal will be either unskilled or unemployed,
and less than 2%  of the time will he be a computer executive.

In more than 40% of the cases that the center studied, criminals stole money,
and if cash wasn&#039;t their style, they split between stealing information or
programs and damaging software.

For these crimes, 4/5ths of those caught had to pay a fine or do community
service or both, or serve less than 6 months in jail.  In close to 1/5th of the
cases, the criminal&#039;s only punishment was to make restitution.

Some notes from Sally Ride:::Space Cadet
----------------------------------------
Pisses me off! How dare they suggest we are not GENIUS computer programmers! Oh
wait a minute, I know why they screwed up the statistics! They haven&#039;t caught
the geniuses, so we throw off the statistical skew since we&#039;re still free.

Also I think it&#039;s high time computer executives start accounting for their fair
share of computer crime! They probably don&#039;t get in the statistics either since
they pull off the really big money rip-offs and it doesn&#039;t get published by the
high power companies they work for so the public keeps faith in them.

Dan Pasquale:  Still Hostile or Ancient History?              September 8, 1986
------------------------------------------------
Some updated information on Sergeant Dan Pasquale (Fremont, CA Police
Department) aka The Revenger here.  Supposedly he has been calling Oryan QUEST
on several occasions and filling in Oryan as to his plans on whom to bust.
However, an investigation into the truth of this matter shows otherwise.

Most recently, Oryan QUEST informed me that Dan Pasquale was  trying to gain
information on The Yakuza.  I told The Yakuza about this and had him call Dan
himself to find out what was going on.

Apparently he had no idea of who he was and had no idea of what he was talking
about. He just said he&#039;d no idea what I was talking about.  He also said that
he&#039;d heard about a Shooting Shark incident much like this one. The Rocker of
Speed Demon Elite also has called him claiming a similar story.  The weird
thing is, he also claims to not have talked to Oryan QUEST since around the
beginning of summer.  [Please note that Shooting Shark and The Rocker have been
disliked by Oryan QUEST for some time and that situation has not changed].

Dan seemed pretty lax, didn&#039;t get excited, and seemed like a decent person all
around.  He said he hadn&#039;t been on a board for at least 3 months and that board
was a legit one at that.  He concluded by saying he didn&#039;t know who or why
these rumors were starting up.

Some last things to add, Dan said that he isn&#039;t into busting phreaks/hackers
and all that stuff anymore.  He just proved his point with Phoenix Phortress,
took his raise, and got out of the deal.  He is now teaching at the academy and
is doing patrols.  But, aside from that, he claims to have nothing at all to do
with the modem world.

                  Information Provided By [%] The Yakuza [%]

           Please refer to past issues of Phrack World News for more
             information on Dan Pasquale and/or Phoenix Phortress

Zigmond Exposed                                               September 1, 1986
---------------
Finally after months of confusion and question, the truth about Daniel Zigmond
is out.  It would appear that Zigmond is not an on-staff programmer at Carnegie
Mellon University after all, but instead was a sort of part time worker there.
Indeed, Daniel just graduated high school with the class of 1986 and currently
attends the University of Pittsburgh this fall.  He started part time work at
CMU on April 1, 1984 (April Fools? Not this time).

He does have a book coming out on Lisp programming which is what he did at
Carnegie Mellon.  All of this information came from his boss at CMU.  As for
Amiga World, Daniel has submitted a few articles, but he isn&#039;t &quot;on staff.&quot;
This came from his Amiga World editor.

The reason there is nothing listed in his TRW account now is obvious since he
is not old enough to have obtained credit cards, bought a car/house, or much of
anything else.

Zigmond says he lied about his age because he thought he would get more
respect.  He thought that people would think he was a rodent if they knew he
was only 17 years old.

Daniel Zigmond received(s) quite a lot of prank phone calls, including a bomb
threat that brought the police to his house, and I ask everyone to stop.  He
tried to screw around with the phreak/hack community, but no damage was done.
Its time to leave him alone because ragging serves no purpose.

As for his article...only time will tell, but the general idea is that he made
that up too just so he could become involved with the phreak/hack community.

Maxfield Strikes Again                                          August 20, 1986
----------------------                                          ---------------
Many of you probably remember a system known as &quot;THE BOARD&quot; in the Detroit 313
NPA.  The number was 313-592-4143 and the newuser password was
&quot;HEL-N555,ELITE,3&quot; (then return).  It was kind of unique because it was run off
of an HP2000 computer.

On the Private Sector BBS (Sponsored by 2600 Magazine), Bill From RNOC had
posted a list of numbers that were related to John Maxfield and while none of
the numbers were anything close to the bbs number listed above, Bill reminded
us that Maxfield was the proud owner of an HP2000 computer.

This started started several people (including Sally Ride:::Space Cadet and
myself) thinking that there might be a connection.  Using resources that I
cannot reveal, I was able to prove that &quot;THE BOARD&quot; was indeed a
Maxfield/BoardScan operation.  I also had learned that the BBS number itself
really had call forwarding to one of Maxfield&#039;s own numbers.  On August 15,
1986 I made this knowledge semi-public and warned Sally Ride:::Space Cadet and
Ax Murderer (who lives locally to Maxfield).  Unfortunately these warnings were
in vain because on August 20, 1986 the following messages were found and sent
to me by Sally Ride.

From:    HIGH TECH
Posted:   8/20/86 @ 12.08 hours

Greetings:

You are now on THE BOARD, a &quot;sting&quot; BBS operated by MIKE WENDLAND of the
WDIV-TV I-Team.  The purpose?  To demonstrate and document the extent of
criminal and potentially illegal hacking and telephone fraud activity by the
so-called &quot;hacking community.&quot;

Thanks for your cooperation.  In the past month and a half, we&#039;ve received all
sorts of information from you implicating many of you to credit card fraud,
telephone billing fraud, vandalism, and possible break-ins to government or
public safety computers.  And the beauty of this is we have your posts, your
E-Mail and--- most importantly ---your REAL names and addresses.

What are we going to do with it?  Stay tuned to News 4.  I plan a special
series of reports about our experiences with THE BOARD, which saw users check
in from coast-to-coast and Canada, users ranging in age from 12 to 48.  For our
regular users, I have been known as High Tech, among other ID&#039;s.  John Maxfield
of Boardscan served as our consultant and provided the HP2000 that this &quot;sting&quot;
ran on.  Through call forwarding and other conveniences made possible by
telephone technology, the BBS operated remotely here in the Detroit area.

When will our reports be ready?  In a few weeks.  We now will be contacting
many of you directly, talking with law enforcement and security agents from
credit card companies and the telephone services.

It should be a hell of a series.  Thanks for your help.  And don&#039;t bother
trying any harassment.  Remember, we&#039;ve got YOUR real names.

Mike Wendland
The I-team
WDIV, Detroit, MI.

Hey guys, he really had us for awhile.  For any of you who posted illegal shit,
I feel sorry for you.  I just can&#039;t wait to see his little news article.  Cable
Pair, do you have some sort of problem?  If you&#039;ve noticed, just about
*everything* posted on this board is *legal*!!!  So fuck off!  You wanna get

Maxfield is in general pretty proud of his efforts with THE BOARD.  He says
that a lot of the people that he voice verified should have known it was him.
However, it is believed that he had a kid helping him do some of the
validations.

According to John F. Maxfield the only reason this sting board was done was to
show &quot;What is currently happening in the phreak/hack community.&quot;   He said no
legal action will be taken at all, and besides, its fattened his &quot;dossiers&quot; on
a lot of people!

There is a bulletin board called Alpha Center in the 514 NPA (Canada) that is
being run by a guy named Mike Holmes who is writing a book on the personalities
of phreakers and hackers.  Mike will ask for your real name, address, phone
number and other things, but it is not completely required.   The board is 300
baud only.

The name of the book is reported to be &quot;Phreak me out!&quot; and it is supposed to
be &quot;not about how to phreak or hack, but about hackers lives and their trials
and tribulations.&quot;   If you would like to find out more about this board or the
book before calling, either contact Attila the Hun or leave Mike Holmes a
message at his voice mailbox (214)733-5283.   For the general password contact
anyone of the below contributors, myself or Taran King.

People in foreign countries will soon be able to have the benefits of our
famous 800 (toll free) numbers.  In place of the 800 number, foreign callers
will dial 196. This will be followed by a unique prefix and the line number
from the company&#039;s domestic 800 service.

It would work like this: 196-NXX-XXXX.  AT&amp;T will bill and record all these
calls.  This will give our overseas (and maybe Canada too) friends the
opportunity to take advantage of the US toll network.

Some notes about Night Stalker&#039;s bust here, I haven&#039;t really talked much to him
because his phone line is bugged, I could tell that much from all of the clicks
that I heard after he had hung up while I was still on the line.

Some of the reasons that he may have been busted were that credit Card numbers
were frequently posted on The Underground and two months ago a member of the
Underground called the White House with a bomb threat and was later visited by
the U.S. Secret Service.  They knew this person had used illegal extenders and
codes to make the call.  They inquired to where he obtained them and he told
them all about The Underground.

He is currently under surveillance, the Secret Service thinks he is
transferring funds and have been following him and taking pictures, especially
when he visited his bank.   That&#039;s about all I know...end of the investigation.

In the last week of July, Cyclone II mistakenly was playing with a local VAX
and became a bit careless with his methods.  He was caught.  You may have
noticed that he hasn&#039;t been calling around for quite awhile.  He won&#039;t be until
this mess is cleared up, which should be in the near future.

His computer was confiscated, as well as all of his files, papers, notes, and
anything else the authorities could find that was illegal.  He is laying low
and would prefer not to receive too many calls.

For those of us that subscribe to Home Box Office (HBO), did any of you see the
HBO movie, Apology?   Well the movie was based on fact and being that Apology
can be accessed from a phone line I feel that it could be considered as
possibly having something to do with phreaking.   This Apology differs a little
from the movie, because with this one you can hear other people&#039;s Apology&#039;s as
well including the statements made from two phreaks in the Southern Bell area.

These two phone phreaks/hackers/credit carders/anarchists as they described
themselves apologized for all sorts of crimes including $200,000 phone bills to
their phone company, bomb threats to their school, and prank calls to Hong
Kong, Egypt, and London.   One of the phreaks identified themselves as &quot;The
Cop.&quot;  Just thought you might be interested to know about it...-KL

[It&#039;s common knowledge that a BBS userlog must be blanked before a BBS can be
used as a sting board.  I&#039;ve also heard that law enforcement officials have
been trying to bust P-80 and Scan Man for a long time, but have not been able
to accomplish anything.  Even the infamous Detective Dan Pasquale {See past
issues of Phrack World News, &quot;Phoenix Phortress Stings 7&quot; and &quot;Oryan QUEST Vs.
Dan Pasquale&quot;} and John Maxfield, head of BoardScan, are frustrated at being
unable to deal with Scan Man.  On June 20, 1986, or thereabouts, the following

Hey check it out, I use TMC in Youngstown, Ohio (216-743-6533), but when TMC
calls my phreak friends, they think the calls originate from Akron, Ohio which
is 60 or so miles away.  So when TMC calls and asks, &quot;Do you know anyone in
Akron?&quot; people usually are honest and just say no.  So even if I call
+relatives, etc. usually I&#039;m safe.

I was wandering around some guys hard drive this weekend and found some AT&amp;T
mail regarding TMC.  From what I understand TMC is involved in the AT&amp;T
AGETRIAL project.  Which indicates to me that TMC is also into computers and
consequently knows what a hacker is.  Another thing that was found was some
information on the 1PSS switch that has been developed by AT&amp;T and has already
been deployed in dome BOCS and other communications networks.  This troubles me
in that this is the first that I have heard about it.  I meant to say that it
has been deployed on some networks already.  If you have any valid information
on the 1PSS SWITCH please post it and it will show up in the P.H.I.R.M. update
issue for July, giving you credit for the information of course.

[***IMPORTANT***  This is TMC&#039;s Miami, Florida dial-up.  An interesting request
from the sysop of one of the nation&#039;s top code boards.  For those of you who
remember it was Scan Man who asked the infamous Whacko Cracko Brothers, Inc.
{See PWN Issue II, &quot;The Life And Crimes of The Whacko Cracko Brothers, Inc.&quot;}
to scan some codes on a certain dial-up just before they were arrested.  Now he

Well sorry it took me so long to find this message I kept forgetting to look at
this one.  Anyway if you really need some [codes, referring to the last
message] I can dig some up easy enough well hack some I should say noting you
can get about 100 in a matter a 10 or 15 minutes so its no big deal to me
either way also watch 800 637 7377 I&#039;m telling you now people that this company
has tracing stuff and I have talked with them they offer me a job and I&#039;m goin
to take it but dont worry I&#039;m not goin to be busting people I have to make it
so you guys cant get in notin it is very easy to make it at least very hard to
do ho well be careful.

[Be careful indeed! 800-637-7377 is TMC&#039;s Las Vegas dial-up.  What would you do
if you were about to lose your computer and maybe your freedom?  Work for the
other side?  The kid really has a way with words, I haven&#039;t seen spelling and
grammer like that since first grade.  As for his not busting people, isn&#039;t that
a laugh, he has already stated that he will bust anyone he can starting with
the lower level phreaks who are only into code abuse.]

Well you see I came very close to getting busted they called my voice line that
is TMC of 800 637 7377 and I have never given it out to anyone at all [I bet!]
so I knew that i was in for it they told me they knew I ran a board and they
said they could not get in I kept deleted them haha anyways I had 2 choices 1
take it down 2 get busted.

[Wonder how they got your home number Shawn?  Did you give it out for
validation on Pirate-80?  Maybe around the time of the &quot;Bi-annual userlog

for any other line running into a house where a suspect BBS is running?]

good friend Shawn of Phreakers Quest just had his BBS put down from them.
Shawn met some guy from TMC, and they have had ANI on the number for months
now.  If you value your own security, throw away any and all TMC information
NOW, or you might be suffering the consequences later.

For details on the &quot;Bust&quot; call Theives Underground II.  It&#039;s SCARY!

          Where is Thieves Underground located?

[Why is Scan Man so interested in what Shawn is saying about his experience
with TMC?  I mean plenty of people on Pirate-80 have run-ins with some form of
security everyday and he doesn&#039;t go researching them, why is this &quot;TMC Run-IN&quot;
so important to him?   Maybe he has a personal reason to be interested, then
again maybe not.]

If you want some details why dont you just ask me seeing as though i would be
the one to ask the TU only knows what i tell him and scan man i need to talk
with you about this they did have an idea of some things going on here and so
one i would rather say it to yo then type it in

shawn

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Indeed, what is going on here Shawn?  Just what did TMC mention about
Pirate-80?  And why not post it in on the public boards?  For the answer to
that maybe one could talk to Jeff Namey who works for TMC and is very proud to
acclaim the efforts of one Scott Higgonbotham and his sting BBS Pirate 80 which
has, in his own words, &quot;Saved my company from near bankruptcy at the hands of
the hackers.&quot;

It is also interesting to note that Scan Man recently admitted to being a
computer security consultant in Phrack Pro-Phile IV.  He said his boss didn&#039;t
know about his outside phreak/hack interests.

Scan Man also claims to have infiltrated various security organizations.  I
wonder if he has infiltrated or simply joined as a regular member.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are highlights of a conversation with Ben Graves of TMC, around
August 25th or 26th (SR=Sally Ride   BG=Ben Graves):

SR:  Mr. Graves I need to talk to you about one of your employee&#039;s a Scott
     Higgonbotham (Scan Man).

BG:  What about Scott?

SR:  Well, my company is concerned with the impact of computer hackers on our
     business.  Scott attended a convention in Miami around January and gave
     his business card to one of our security people.  I&#039;m following up on
     their conversation with the idea that perhaps my company could be given
     access to Scott&#039;s electronic bulletin board.  In this way we could monitor
     for hackers abusing our codes.

BG:  That may be something we can arrange.  I know that Scott has been a great
     help to TMC since we were able to pick him up.  We began to have a big
     problem with hackers awhile back and Scott seems to have some of the
     answers.  He&#039;s not in right now, can I have your number and I&#039;ll have him
     call you back?

SR:  You sure can.  So, Scott&#039;s bulletin board has helped you reduce your
     losses to toll fraud?

BG:  Well,  that&#039;s just one of the ways Scott has used to work on the problem.
     But, he has been very effective.

SR:  Thanks, Ben, I&#039;ll be waiting for the call.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are highlights of conversation with Pauline Frazier of TMC from
around September 5, 1986   (Sally Ride: SR   Pauline Frazier: PF)

Operator:  TMC, may I help you?

SR:  Yes, Ben Graves, please.

Operator:  I&#039;m sorry, Mr. Graves is no longer employed here.

SR:  Oh!? Well, is Scott Higgonbotham in?

Operator:  One moment, please.

PF:  Hello, this is Pauline Frazier, I&#039;m the office manager, may I help you?

SR:  Well, maybe, I was trying to reach Ben Graves, I just talked to him last
     week about another one of your employees, Scott Higgonbotham, now the
     receptionist says Ben no longer works here.

PF:  Yes, that is true, and neither does Mr. Higgonbotham.

SR:  May I ask why?

PF:  I&#039;m really not able to say much, I think you should talk to our
     Regional Security Director,  Kevin Griffo, he&#039;s on 804-625-1110.  He could
     tell you much more than I can.

SR:  O.K., but maybe I should tell you why I&#039;m interested.  I  was talking to
     Ben about an electronic bulletin board Scott is running.  My company has
     someone on it and we&#039;re concerned that things might not be legal on there.
     There are access codes being posted of my company&#039;s and yours&#039;.  Could
     that be why they&#039;re no longer employed?

PF:  Do you mean he is posting TMC codes on there?

SR:  Well, I can&#039;t say he&#039;s the one posting the codes, but he is letting them
     be posted, along with a lot of other information such as computer logins
     and passwords.

PF:  Well, you know I never did like it when they hired that fellow.  And,
     I told them so, too.  When he started we had a problem with toll fraud,
     but nothing like it is now.   He was able to catch a few of those hackers
     while he was here, and we pressed charges, but the problem just seemed to
     get worse and worse.

SR:  So, he actually had some hackers arrested?

PF:  Yes, several.  He started working here in Charleston and then they
     sent him to New York when things got bad up there.   But, things never
     have gotten any better since he&#039;s started here or in New York either.
     Sir, please, call Mr. Griffo about all this he can tell you more than I.

SR:  I will.  Do you think he&#039;d be in now?

PF:  Well, it&#039;s late here and he&#039;s probably gone home, try Monday.

SR:  Thanks, I will.

     (But you told me plenty, sweetheart!)

[For the record I had a VERY similar chat with Pauline Frazier, it turned up
the same results.]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following are highlights of a conversation with Kevin Griffo, TMC,
September 9th (Sally Ride:  SR  Kevin Griffo: KG).

Oper:  TMC, may I help you?

SR:  Yes, Kevin Griffo, please.

Oper:  His line is busy now, can he call you back?

SR:  Well, this is urgent, may I hold?

Oper:  Certainly, I&#039;ll let him know you&#039;re holding.

KG:  Hello, this is Kevin.

SR:  Mr.  Griffo I&#039;ve been referred to you by one of your Charleston employees,
     Pauline Frazier.  She felt I should tell you what I told her yesterday
     about one of your now former employees, I think, Scott Higgonbotham.

KG:  Yeah, we let him go just last week.  What about him?

SR:  My company feels Scott is running an illegal BBS and has for sometime been
     allowing access codes to be posted.  Codes for your company&#039;s toll
     switches as well as ours and other&#039;s are being entered on his system as
     well as computer system logins and passwords.

KG:  Well, I&#039;m not surprised.  I have been to Scott&#039;s home to see the bulletin
     board.  I knew codes were being posted, but I thought he was taking care
     of reporting them.

SR:  May I ask why you let him go?

KG:  Certainly, Scott just wasn&#039;t solving our problems.  In fact, some of our
     people have thought he was somewhat to blame for many of them.   Even
     though, at first, he appeared to be the answer.  He was able to identify
     several computer hackers for us.

SR:  So, he did bust some hackers?  Has he done so recently?  I think a young
     man using the name Shawn on the bulletin boards was recently identified by
     your company.

KG:  No, he hasn&#039;t gotten anyone recently that I&#039;m aware of, but he could have
     turned them over to one of the local franchises.  You see TMC is a
     franchise operation.   We try to help the franchises, but many do their
     own thing.  We wouldn&#039;t necessarily know about all that goes on.

SR:  I&#039;m sorry to hear you had this trouble.  Perhaps, my company could
     be of assistance.  We do work of a similar nature.

KG:  I&#039;d certainly be interested in any help you could give.  Can you put
     together a written proposal?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also had an interesting conversation with Larry Algard of Pacific Northwest
Bell.  He confirmed that he had met Scott Higgonbotham at the Miami CFCA
conference last January.  He also mentioned that Scott had told him about his
&quot;sting&quot; bulletin board, Pirate-80 in West Virginia.

For those who are interested:

               Parlor Suite
               Charleston, West Virginia 25301

All the thoughts in []&#039;s and other information are the insane ramblings of
Sally Ride:::Space Cadet and Knight Lightning, you tell me, are we spaced out
or what?!   The TMC employee interviews were by Sally Ride:::Space Cadet with
me doing the background information.

It was at this point in time that we decided to have a talk with Scan Man
directly and give him a chance to clear his name and reputation.

Unfortunately, Scan Man was very uncooperative and constantly avoided answering
the questions I asked him.  He also added that everything said in the
interviews were lies.  He claims that Kevin Griffo has never been to his house,
he doesn&#039;t know Ben Graves, and Pauline Frazier hated him because she knew he
was a hacker.

He then went on to imply that Sally Ride:::Space Cadet was actually an employee
of some communications carrier himself because of the terminology he used in
some of his posts on P-80.

Scan Man claimed that he has been telling people that he worked for TMC for
quite some time and he only needed the codes from Shawn because he was going to
be in Miami later that week.  In other words, Shawn&#039;s near bust and his asking
for TMC codes may have been a simple coincidence.

He claims to have done system analysis for TMC, but also admitted to securing
some of their computer systems, which isn&#039;t a crime.

As for his being at the Miami CFCA conference, I will assume that he was
infiltrating the con and was spotted as being a hacker.  In order to gain the
respect and confidence of the security officials, he told them that his
bulletin board was a sting.   Now, that story completely is believable with the
exception of how he arrived, a plane trip paid for by TMC.

Scan Man&#039;s last words contained a threat that if this affected his home life,
he would personally track down the writers and contributors and shoot them with
his rifle.

Notes from KL:

One thing that I should mention is the fact that Pirate-80 has *NEVER* been
busted or investigated.  I mean its not hard to get onto and there are codes
plastered everywhere you look.  How many boards do you know of that have been
busted for having codes on them?  One example of this is with the credit card
numbers owned by Richard Sandza, author of &quot;The Night Of The Hackers&quot; and &quot;The
Revenge Of The Hackers,&quot; both printed in Newsweek Magazine.

&quot;It wasn&#039;t long before I found out what was being done with my credit-card
 numbers, thanks to another friendly hacker who tipped me to Pirate 80, a
 bulletin board in Charleston, W. Va., where I found this:  &#039;I&#039;m sure you guys
 have heard about Richard Standza [sic] or Montana Wildhack.  He&#039;s the guy who
 wrote the obscene story about phreaking in NewsWeek [sic].  Well, my friend
 did a credit card check on TRW...try this number, it&#039;s a VISA...Please nail
 this guy bad...Captain Quieg [sic].&#039;&quot;

See this?  This was published in &quot;The Revenge Of The Hackers&quot; in Newsweek
Magazine!  And what happened to P-80?  Nothing!  Here Richard Sandza has just
announced to thousands of people that P-80 has credit card numbers posted on it
and nothing happened.  Why?  The answer to that is left to the reader.

There are a few other things to mention about Scan Man/P-80/TMC.  Supposedly
all of the computer equipment that P-80 runs on was donated by TMC themselves.
It is also believed that Scan Man&#039;s only duty to the company was to report TMC
codes so that they could be turned off.  It would appear that this had changed
but, we at Phrack Inc. in no way take any opinion whatsoever about the
innocence or guilt of Scan Man.  We leave it to the reader to decide for
him/herself.

I&#039;m sure all parties concerned would appreciate you NOT calling the above
numbers if all you plan to do is harass people or anything else among those
same lines.  After all a job is a job and harassing someone wouldn&#039;t do
anyone any good either, it would just make them mad.  If you are going to call,
make sure it is for knowledge purposes only!  Above all do NOT call Scan Man to
harass him or his innocent family.  My suggestion is that if you feel that Scan
Man is an informant or whatever, then stop just calling his board.

One last thing, a *VERY* big thank you to Sally Ride:::Space Cadet for a job
well done and for all the time he spent working on the article.

PS: For those interested, this investigation was sparked by the interception of
    a memo from Larry Algard (Pacific Northwest Bell) to his boss, George Reay.
    What was in the memo?  Several things, but mostly it spoke of the January
    CFCA (Communications Fraud Control Association) conference in Miami,
    Florida where Larry met one Scott Higgonbotham, Security Director for TMC
    (Tele-Marketing Company) who told him that he operated a &quot;sting&quot; bulletin
    board named Pirate 80 in West Virginia.

                        easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
                        proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
                        actionable data right away.

                    <p>The <a href="/google-hacking-database">Google Hacking Database (GHDB)</a>
                        is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
                        and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
                        this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
                        information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
                        subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
                    </p>

                    <p>The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
                        Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
                        Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
                        member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
                        by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
                        recorded at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html"
                                       target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEFCON 13</a>. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
                        to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
                        the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
                        unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
                        Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
                        information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
                        show examples of vulnerable web sites.
                    </p>

                    <p>After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
                        over to <a
                                href="https://www.offensive-security.com/community-projects/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offensive Security</a> in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
                        an extension of the <a href="/">Exploit Database</a>. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
                        other online search engines such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing</a>,
                        and other online repositories like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>,
                        producing different, yet equally valuable results.
