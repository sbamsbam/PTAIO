                               December 24, 1989

     Welcome to Issue 30 of Phrack Inc.  We are releasing this just a few short
days before the start of a new decade and proud to say that we will continue to
bring you more information well into the 1990s.

     SummerCon 1990!  That&#039;s right.  Preliminary plans are being made right
now, so, starting with this issue, keep your eye on Phrack World News for
details!  The dates have been decided so mark your calendars!

     This issue of Phrack Inc. features a large article by Goe that contains
some information about VM/CMS which can, if used properly, be of great use.
Also in this issue, Jack T. Tab brings us a VAX/VMS version of the Fakemail
program that was featured for Unix in Phrack Inc. Volume Three, Issue 27, File
#8.  Also, Network Miscellany III, compiled by Taran King, contains a
relatively large list of FTP sites that allow anonymous FTP for those of you
who have been poking and stabbing around the Internet.  These along with all of
the rest of the articles should prove to be interesting reading for you!

     Do you have access to the Wide Area Networks?  Are you on Fidonet?  How
about UUCP or CompuServe?  If so, you can drop a line to us through the
networks at the addresses listed below.  We&#039;d love to hear from you!

CARL
~~~~
The Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, or CARL, is an on-line service
providing information from its member libraries as well as select information
databases.  The member libraries include Auraria, CU Health Sciences Center, CU
Law Library, Denver Public Library, Denver University, Denver University Law
School, Colorado School of Mines, University of Northern Colorado, University
of Wyoming, Government Publications, plus about five community colleges, Regis
College, Colorado State Publications, State Department of Education, Pikes Peak
Library, MARMOT Library System, and Boulder Public Library.  The information
databases include the following:  UnConver -- Article Access, &quot;Facts,&quot;
Encyclopedia, Metro Denver Facts, Info Colorado, Boston Library Consortium,
Library News, and New Journal Issues.

CARL is available via Telnet at PAC.CARL.ORG (192.54.81.128) and is pretty
clear to understand.  The Encyclopedia information database, unfortunately,
requires a valid username on the system.


COMPUSERVE ACCESS VIA INTERNET
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can access CompuServe via Telnet through the gateway/concentrator at
CTS.MERIT.EDU (35.1.1.6) by typing &quot;CompuServe&quot; at the &quot;Which Host?&quot; prompt.

CTS.MERIT.EDU (35.1.1.6) is a Cisco terminal server installed primarily for
users of the Merit computer network in Michigan.  This machine has a bunch of
serial lines going in each direction to/from a Merit Secondary Communications
Processor (SCP), which is the entity that gives you the &quot;Which Host?&quot; prompt.

Some other of the Merit services (like outbound Telnet from &quot;Which Host?&quot;) have
been intentionally limited so that they only work within Merit.  Part of this
is apparently for reasons of accountability and security (no random hackers
dialing in and hacking machines in New Zealand) and part is for access control
(ports are scarce and services have costs so they try to limit who uses the
thing to paying customers).

CompuServe bills connections via this link as if it were via Telenet (which is
EXPENSIVE!).  It&#039;s an X.25 connection somewhere at a decently fast speed.

If you have particular questions about all of the various services that can be
accessed through Merit, either through the terminal server at CTS.MERIT.EDU
(35.1.1.6), Telneting directly into a Merit SCP or PCP, or via dial-up access,
contact merit_computer_network@UM.CC.UMICH.EDU or INFO@MERIT on Bitnet.

For more details about what can be accessed via CTS.MERIT.EDU, stay tuned to
Network Miscellany for part IV in an upcoming issue of Phrack!


DATE AND TIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Here&#039;s an interesting little trick.  Just in case you are on some system
without the ability to report what time it is by a command, connect via Telnet
to port 13 of an Internet Unix system.  This gives you the time and date and
then disconnects.  Some example systems of this include RUTGERS.EDU,
MICA.BERKELEY.EDU, UCBVAX.BERKELEY.EDU, and PIKES.COLORADO.EDU (example:
Telnet RUTGERS.EDU 13).


FTP
~~~
File Transfer Protocol or FTP is a way to transfer data or text files over the
Internet from remote sites.  The only problem is figuring out where something
is that you want to get.

The following is a list of sites accepting anonymous FTP user=anonymous,
password=login.  It was compiled by Jon Granrose with the help of a number of
contributors as well as a couple of lists that had been started.  If you have
any comments, additions, or corrections, mail them to odin@UCSCB.UCSC.EDU or
odin@ucscb.UUCP or 74036.3241@COMPUSERVE.COM.

MELVYL ONLINE CATALOG
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This service is provided by the University of California schools.  It is
available via Telnet by connecting to MELVYL.UCOP.EDU (31.1.0.1).  It basically
provides information searching capabilities and provides literary sources where
the &quot;keyword&quot; that you used may be found.  It is relatively self-explanatory.


NAMESERVERS
~~~~~~~~~~~
By connecting to port 101 on certain Internet systems, you have connected to
the nameserver of that domain.  To get a list of all of the subdomains of the
main domain, type ALL.  A sample system is VIOLET.BERKELEY.EDU but be
forewarned that the output from typing ALL is *EXTREMELY* long on this
particular system! (Example: Telnet VIOLET.BERKELEY.EDU 101).


PUBLIC ACCESS UNIX INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For those of you that are still interested in more information on the Public
Access Unix systems that were listed in Network Miscellany II featured in
Phrack 29, here are a few more details.  For specific information concerning
the nodes discussed, refer to the previous article.

For those of you who are not local to a Public Access Unix system, Portal can
be reached via PC-Pursuit for $25 a month and a $10 access fee for &quot;portal&quot;
(off-peak).  For information, contact John Little (jel@CUP.PORTAL.COM).


The Big Electric Cat (dasys1.UUCP) claims to be cheaper than most well-
connected public sites.  They have special billing for &quot;organizational&quot;
accounts if you&#039;re interested and their standard rate is $5 a month for an
account (no time restrictions).  The Big Electric Cat offers a superset of the
USENET newsgroups as well as unrestricted mail (!), a simplified set of prompts
for most system functions, games, and several other features


The World (WORLD.STD.COM) in Brookline, MA (Boston) is a Sun4/280 running
Sun/OS 4.0.3 (Unix.)  They offer electronic mail (to most anyplace), USENET,
ClariNet and general Unix access.  They dial UUNET and other sites frequently.

To create an account you just dial (617)739-WRLD (9753) and login as user &quot;new&quot;
(the login prompt gives instructions).  They ask for some info (name, address,
etc.) and a MasterCard or Visa account.

  Rates for The World
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  All times are East Coast, USA.

  INITIAL SIGN-UP
  $25.00 fee, applied to first month&#039;s charges.
  BASIC ACCESS RATES
         8AM-6PM        $8.00/hour (Monday thru Friday)
         6PM-12M        $5.00/hour
         12M-8AM        $2.50/hour
  Weekends and holidays, 8AM-12M, $5/hour.

  Disk Quota
  ~~~~~~~~~~
  A &quot;byte&quot; is equivalent to one character of storage.
  A disk block is 1024 bytes.
         First 512 disk blocks              No Charge
         Additional Quota                   $0.01/block/month
                                            (approx. $10/MB/month)
  Note that disk charges are based on your requested disk quota (system imposed
  limit on your usage) and not your actual usage. Disk quota charges are
  pro-rated.

  Electronic Mail
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  No charge for electronic mail between users of The World.  No charge for
  first 512 blocks of mail per month.  $0.01 per block of mail thereafter in
  any given month (approx. $10/MB/month).

  CPU Usage
  ~~~~~~~~~
  In general, they do not charge for these resources for typical accounts
  interested in electronic communications.  Customers who wish to use their
  system for compute or memory intensive applications should contact their
  office for rates.

  USENET
  ~~~~~~
  Local usage, no charge.  Network usage, no charge at this time.

  Printing And Fax
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  To be announced.

  Upload or Download Software
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
  No additional charge.


UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT BERKELEY NETWORK INFORMATION
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a service which I, personally, have found to be extremely useful.  If
you need network information on virtually any system, connect to the University
of California at Berkeley Network Information at JADE.BERKELEY.EDU Port 117
(example:  Telnet JADE.BERKELEY.EDU 117).  Once you are logged into the system
automatically, it prompts you for a command or type &quot;?&quot; for a list of commands.
The help menu is relatively easy to understand.  You can get Bitnet network
table listings or Internet numerical addresses or Internet mail exchanger
listings or UUCP node information or UUCP node paths plus more.  It&#039;s very
useful in case you&#039;re having difficulty sending mail to a particular node from
your own node or if you&#039;re trying to connect to a system via FTP or Telnet that
your system doesn&#039;t recognize (i.e. get the numerical address from the server
and FTP or Telnet to the numerical address).

There are literally hundreds of systems connected to some of these larger
networks, like Tymnet and Telenet.  Navigation around these networks is very
simple, and usually well explained in their on-line documentation.
Furthermore, some systems will actually tell you what is connected and how to
get to it.  In the case of Tymnet, after dialing in, at the log in prompt, type
&quot;information&quot; for the on-line documentation.

Accessing systems through networks is as simple as providing an address for it
to connect to.  The best way to learn about the addresses and how to do things
on a network is to read &quot;A Novice&#039;s Guide to Hacking (1989 Edition)&quot; which was
in Issue 22, File 4 of 12, Volume Two (December 23, 1988).  Some points are
re-iterated here.

Once on a network, you provide the NUA (network user address) of the system you
wish to connect to.  NUAs are strings of 15 digits, broken up in to 3 fields,
the NETWORK ADDRESS, the AREA PREFIX, and the DNIC.  Each field has 5 digits,
and are left padded with 0&#039;s where necessary.

The DNIC determines which network to take the address from.  Tymnet, for
example, is 03106. 03110 is Telenet.

The AREA PREFIX and NETWORK ADDRESS determine the connection point.  By
providing the address of the system that you wish to connect to, you will be
accessing it through the net... as if you were calling it directly.  Obviously,
then, this provides one more level of security for access.

By connecting to an outdial, you can increase again the level of security you
enjoy, by using the outdial in that area to connect to the remote system.

Addendum -- Accessing Tymnet Over Local Packet Networks

This is just another way to get that extra step and/or bypass other routes.
This table is copied from Tymnet&#039;s on-line information.  As said earlier, it&#039;s
a great resource, this on-line information!

      -GWY OXXXX-TYMNET: PLEASE LOG IN:

On a side note, the recent book The Cuckoo&#039;s Egg provides some interesting
information (in the form of a story, however) on a Tymnet hacker.  Remember
that he was into BIG things, and hence he was cracked down upon.  If you keep a
low profile, networks should provide a good access method.

If you can find a system that is connected to the Internet that you can get on
from Tymnet, you are doing well.

This file written by Goe (my nickname).  Any comments or criticisms or
corrections are welcomed.  Anyone with a good knowledge can modify this.

The article&#039;s topic is the IBM VM/SP running CMS and using DIRMAINT.  I do not
know if it works in MVS/TSO or VSE.

The first table contains the original default IDs &amp; passwords from IBM Corp.

The second table contains those default IDs &amp; passwords that IBM customized for
its customer.

If you need an explanation about these two tables, you should look at it like
this:

       |------User ID
       |     |-------That User ID&#039;s password
       ^     ^

                     |

Luckily, I have tested the second table in 4 VM systems and it works.  May you
be lucky too!

Of course, since all of us are general users, the first thing to know is how to
get privileges by trying a password or by accident by getting privileged users&#039;
passwords.

While CP/CMS uses passwords to control performance, it must store some
passwords in the REXX command language (EXEC files).  It looks like this:

CP LINK VTAMUSER 191 121 RR VTAM1

If you have succeeded in linking that minidisk then:

AC 121 B
FILEL * * B

Then you can see all of the files owned by VTAMUSER.  Usually people are lazy
enough to remember too many passwords, so to read the passwords.  It may be its
CP pass too!  TRY IT!!!

But IBM is not so stupid as to let any user with privileges open accounts
randomly.  It limits a maximum of 8 superusers to be able to do it.  You may
find it in:

DIRMAINT DATA Y2

Only these DIRM-STAFF can open accounts from the console.  If another user logs
on from a terminal, he will be logged out immediately even though he knew the
password. And only these STAFF have 2 modes of operation to use:

DIRM

One is general user mode and the other is operation mode (Privilege operation)
so you have to cheat the O.S. to think that you are NOT logged in from a
terminal.  Our way is to use TELNET.  Usually this package is named TCPIP.  Do
this:

TELNET yourhost

It will request you logon again.  Then, if you logon with the superuser ID &amp;
password, the O.S. will not recognize that you are from a terminal and will let
you in!!  The most important thing is that IBM stores its user IDs &amp; passwords
in a file:

USER DIRECT

Usually, this file is stored on DIRMAINT&#039;s minidisk and it is a text file!!!  I
do not know why, but it actually is not encrypted!!!!  Incredible to believe...

Once you have this file, you will know all users&#039; passwords and all information
about all users&#039; IDs and I think it is rude to open new accounts!  Poor me!
I&#039;ve done this and lost privs 3 times now.  While there is a way to get back
your privs, first you need find a privileged ID so that you can write your file
in it.  Then, write a EXEC file into it.  This file&#039;s name must be a most
common command that any one will issue.  If the general user uses it, nothing
happens, but if a superuser issues it, then it will do something for you!  Here
is a example:

Please note that wherever you see (cut), it means that the line was too long
and had to be split.  Whenever you see (cut), take the line below the line that
it is on and paste it on the end of the (cut) line (removing the (cut) in the
process).

INTRODUCTION

DECWRL is a mail gateway computer operated by Digital&#039;s Western Research
Laboratory in Palo Alto, California.  Its purpose is to support the interchange
of electronic mail between Digital and the &quot;outside world.&quot;

DECWRL is connected to Digital&#039;s Easynet, and also to a number of different
outside electronic mail networks.  Digital users can send outside mail by
sending to DECWRL::&quot;outside-address&quot;, and digital users can also receive mail
by having your correspondents route it through DECWRL.  The details of incoming
mail are more complex, and are discussed below.

It is vitally important that Digital employees be good citizens of the networks
to which we are connected.  They depend on the integrity of our user community
to ensure that tighter controls over the use of the gateway are not required.
The most important rule is &quot;no chain letters,&quot; but there are other rules
depending on whether the connected network that you are using is commercial or
non-commercial.

The current traffic volume (September 1989) is about 10,000 mail messages per
day and about 3,000 USENET messages per day.  Gatewayed mail traffic has
doubled every year since 1983.  DECWRL is currently a Vax 8530 computer with 48
megabytes of main memory, 2500 megabytes of disk space, 8 9600-baud (Telebit)
modem ports, and various network connections.  They will shortly be upgrading
to a Vax 8650 system.  They run Ultrix 3.0 as the base operating system.


ADMINISTRATION

The gateway has engineering staff, but no administrative or clerical staff.
They work hard to keep it running, but they do not have the resources to answer
telephone queries or provide tutorials in its use.

They post periodic status reports to the USENET newsgroup dec.general.  Various
helpful people usually copy these reports to the VAXNOTES &quot;gateways&quot; conference
within a day or two.


HOW TO SEND MAIL

DECWRL is connected to quite a number of different mail networks.  If you were
logged on directly to it, you could type addresses directly, e.g.

    To: strange!foreign!address.

But since you are not logged on directly to the gateway, you must send mail so
that when it arrives at the gateway, it will be sent as if that address had
been typed locally.


* Sending from VMS

If you are a VMS user, you should use NMAIL, because VMS mail does not know how
to requeue and retry mail when the network is congested or disconnected.  From
VMS, address your mail like this:

    To: nm%DECWRL::&quot;strange!foreign!address&quot;

The quote characters (&quot;) are important, to make sure that VMS doesn&#039;t try to
interpret strange!foreign!address itself.  If you are typing such an address
inside a mail program, it will work as advertised.  If you are using DCL and
typing directly to the command line, you should beware that DCL likes to remove
quotes, so you will have to enclose the entire address in quotes, and then put
two quotes in every place that one quote should appear in the address:

    $ mail test.msg &quot;nm%DECWRL::&quot;&quot;foreign!addr&quot;&quot;&quot; /subj=&quot;hello&quot;

Note the three quotes in a row after foreign!addr.  The first two of them are
doubled to produce a single quote in the address, and the third ends the
address itself (balancing the quote in front of the nm%).

Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from a VMS system:

    To: nm%DECWRL::&quot;lll-winkin!netsys!phrack&quot;
    To: nm%DECWRL::&quot;postmaster@msp.pnet.sc.edu&quot;
    To: nm%DECWRL::&quot;netsys!phrack@uunet.uu.net&quot;
    To: nm%DECWRL::&quot;phrackserv@CUNYVM.bitnet&quot;
    To: nm%DECWRL::&quot;Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org&quot;


* Sending from Ultrix

If your Ultrix system has been configured for it, then you can, from your
Ultrix system, just send directly to the foreign address, and the mail software
will take care of all of the gateway routing for you.  Most Ultrix systems in
Corporate Research and in the Palo Alto cluster are configured this way.

To find out whether your Ultrix system has been so configured, just try it and
see what happens.  If it doesn&#039;t work, you will receive notification almost
instantly.

    NOTE:  The Ultrix mail system is extremely flexible; it is almost
    completely configurable by the customer.  While this is valuable to
    customers, it makes it very difficult to write global instructions for
    the use of Ultrix mailers, because it is possible that the local changes
    have produced something quite unlike the vendor-delivered mailer.  One of
    the popular changes is to tinker with the meaning of quote characters (&quot;)
    in Ultrix addresses.  Some systems consider that these two addresses are
    the same:

        site1!site2!user@host.dec.com

    and

        &quot;site1!site2!user&quot;@host.dec.com

    while others are configured so that one form will work and the other
    will not.  All of these examples use the quotes.  If you have trouble
    getting the examples to work, please try them again without the quotes.
    Perhaps your Ultrix system is interpreting the quotes differently.

If your Ultrix system has an IP link to Palo Alto (type &quot;/etc/ping
decwrl.dec.com&quot; to find out if it does), then you can route your mail to the
gateway via IP.  This has the advantage that your Ultrix mail headers will
reach the gateway directly, instead of being translated into DECNET mail
headers and then back into Ultrix at the other end.  Do this as follows:

    To: &quot;alien!address&quot;@decwrl.dec.com

The quotes are necessary only if the alien address contains a ! character, but
they don&#039;t hurt if you use them unnecessarily.  If the alien address contains
an &quot;@&quot; character, you will need to change it into a &quot;%&quot; character.  For
example, to send via IP to joe@widget.org, you should address the mail

    To: &quot;joe%widget.org&quot;@decwrl.dec.com

If your Ultrix system has only a DECNET link to Palo Alto, then you should
address mail in much the same way that VMS users do, save that you should not
put the nm% in front of the address:

    To: DECWRL::&quot;strange!foreign!address&quot;

Here are some typical outgoing mail addresses as used from an Ultrix system
that has IP access.  Ultrix systems without IP access should use the same
syntax as VMS users, except that the nm% at the front of the address should not
be used.

    To: &quot;lll-winken!netsys!phrack&quot;@decwrl.dec.com
    To: &quot;postmaster%msp.pnet.sc.edu&quot;@decwrl.dec.com
    To: &quot;phrackserv%CUNYVM.bitnet&quot;@decwrl.dec.com
    To: &quot;netsys!phrack%uunet.uu.net&quot;@decwrl.dec.com
    To: &quot;Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org&quot;@decwrl.dec.com


DETAILS OF USING OTHER NETWORKS

All of the world&#039;s computer networks are connected together, more or less, so
it is hard to draw exact boundaries between them.  Precisely where the Internet
ends and UUCP begins is a matter of interpretation.

For purposes of sending mail, though, it is convenient to divide the network
universe into these categories:

Easynet         Digital&#039;s internal DECNET network.  Characterized by addresses
                of the form NODE::USER.  Easynet can be used for commercial
                purposes.

Internet        A collection of networks including the old ARPAnet, the NSFnet,
                the CSnet, and others.  Most international research,
                development, and educational organizations are connected in
                some fashion to the Internet.  Characterized by addresses of
                the form user@site.subdomain.domain.  The Internet itself
                cannot be used for commercial purposes.

UUCP            A very primitive network with no management, built with
                auto-dialers phoning one computer from another.  Characterized
                by addresses of the form place1!place2!user.  The UUCP network
                can be used for commercial purposes provided that none of the
                sites through which the message is routed objects to that.

USENET          Not a network at all, but a layer of software built on top of
                UUCP and Internet.

BITNET          An IBM-based network linking primarily educational sites.
                Digital users can send to BITNET as if it were part of
                Internet, but BITNET users need special instructions for
                reversing the process.  BITNET cannot be used for commercial
                purposes.

Fidonet         A network of personal computers.  I am unsure of the status of
                using Fidonet for commercial purposes, nor am I sure of its
                efficacy.


DOMAINS AND DOMAIN ADDRESSING

There is a particular network called &quot;the Internet;&quot; it is somewhat related to
what used to be &quot;the ARPAnet.&quot;  The Internet style of addressing is flexible
enough that people use it for addressing other networks as well, with the
result that it is quite difficult to look at an address and tell just what
network it is likely to traverse.  But the phrase &quot;Internet address&quot; does not
mean &quot;mail address of some computer on the Internet&quot; but rather &quot;mail address
in the style used by the Internet.&quot;  Terminology is even further confused
because the word &quot;address&quot; means one thing to people who build networks and
something entirely different to people who use them.  In this file an &quot;address&quot;
is something like &quot;mike@decwrl.dec.com&quot; and not &quot;192.1.24.177&quot; (which is what
network engineers would call an &quot;internet address&quot;).

The Internet naming scheme uses hierarchical domains, which despite their title
are just a bookkeeping trick.  It doesn&#039;t really matter whether you say
NODE::USER or USER@NODE, but what happens when you connect two companies&#039;
networks together and they both have a node ANCHOR??  You must, somehow,
specify which ANCHOR you mean.  You could say ANCHOR.DEC::USER or
DEC.ANCHOR::USER or USER@ANCHOR.DEC or USER@DEC.ANCHOR.  The Internet
convention is to say USER@ANCHOR.DEC, with the owner (DEC) after the name
(ANCHOR).

But there could be several different organizations named DEC.  You could have
Digital Equipment Corporation or Down East College or Disabled Education
Committee.  The technique that the Internet scheme uses to resolve conflicts
like this is to have hierarchical domains.  A normal domain isn&#039;t DEC or
STANFORD, but DEC.COM (commercial) and STANFORD.EDU (educational).  These
domains can be further divided into ZK3.DEC.COM or CS.STANFORD.EDU.  This
doesn&#039;t resolve conflicts completely, though:  both Central Michigan University
and Carnegie-Mellon University could claim to be CMU.EDU.  The rule is that the
owner of the EDU domain gets to decide, just as the owner of the CMU.EDU gets
to decide whether the Electrical Engineering department or the Elementary
Education department gets subdomain EE.CMU.EDU.

The domain scheme, while not perfect, is completely extensible.  If you have
two addresses that can potentially conflict, you can suffix some domain to the
end of them, thereby making, say, decwrl.UUCP be somehow different from
DECWRL.ENET.

DECWRL&#039;s entire mail system is organized according to Internet domains, and in
fact we handle all mail internally as if it were Internet mail.  Incoming mail
is converted into Internet mail, and then routed to the appropriate domain; if
that domain requires some conversion, then the mail is converted to the
requirements of the outbound domain as it passes through the gateway.  For
example, they put Easynet mail into the domain ENET.DEC.COM, and they put
BITNET mail into the domain BITNET.

The &quot;top-level&quot; domains supported by the DECWRL gateway are these:

  .EDU        Educational institutions
  .COM        Commercial institutions
  .GOV        Government institutions
  .MIL        Military institutions
  .ORG        Various organizations
  .NET        Network operations
  .BITNET     The BITNET
  .MAILNET    The MAILNET
  .??         2-character country code for routing to other countries
  .OZ         Part of the Australian (.AU) name space.

2-character country codes include UK (United Kingdom), FR (France), IT (Italy),
CA (Canada), AU (Australia), etc.  These are the standard ISO 2-character
country codes.


MAILING TO EASYNET

To mail to user SPRINTER at node WASH (which is DECNET address WASH::SPRINTER),
Internet mail should be addressed to sprinter@wash.enet.dec.com.  Easynet
addresses are not case-dependent; WASH and wash are the same node name and
SPRINTER and sprinter are the same user name.

Sites that are not directly connected to the Internet may have difficulty with
Internet addresses like wash.enet.dec.com.  They can send into the Easynet by
explicitly routing the mail through DECWRL.  From domain-based Internet
mailers, the address would be sprinter%wash.enet@decwrl.dec.com.  From UUCP
mailers, the address would be decwrl!wash.enet!sprinter. Some Internet mailers
require the form &lt;@decwrl.dec.com:sprinter@wash.enet&gt;.  (This last form is the
only technically correct form of explicit route, but very few Internet sites
support it.)

The DECWRL gateway also supports various obsolete forms of addressing that are
left over from the past.  In general they support obsolete address forms for
two years after the change, and then remove it.


MAILING TO DIGITAL ALL-IN-1 USERS

Some Easynet users do not have a direct DECNET node address, but instead read
their mail with All-in-1, which uses addresses of the form &quot;Nate State @UCA&quot;.
Here &quot;UCA&quot; is a Digital location code name.  To route mail to such people, send
to Nate.State@UCA.MTS.DEC.COM.  Mail received from the All-in-1 mailer is
unreplyable, and in fact unless the respondent tells you his return address in
the body of the message, it is not normally possible even to puzzle out the
return address by studying the message header.  Mail from All-in-1 to Easynet
passes through a gateway program that does not produce valid return addresses.


MAILING TO THE INTERNET

DECWRL&#039;s mailer is an Internet mailer, so to mail to an Internet site, just use
its address.  If you are having trouble determining the Internet address, you
might find that the Ultrix host table /etc/hosts.txt is useful.  If you can&#039;t
find one anywhere else, there&#039;s one on DECWRL.  See the comments above under
&quot;how to send mail&quot; for details about making sure that the mail program you are
using has correctly interpreted an address.


MAILING TO UUCP

UUCP mail is manually routed by the sender, using ! as the separator character.
Thus, the address xxx!yyy!zzz!user means to dial machine xxx and relay to it
the mail, with the destination address set to yyy!zzz!user.  That machine in
turn dials yyy, and the process repeats itself.

To correctly address UUCP mail, you must know a working path through the UUCP
network.  The database is sufficiently chaotic that automatic routing does not
work reliably (though many sites perform automatic routing anyhow).  The
information about UUCP connectivity is distributed in the USENET newsgroup
comp.mail.maps; many sites collect this data and permit local queries of it.

At the end of this file is a list of the UUCP nodes to which DECWRL currently
has a working connection.


MAILING TO USENET

Usenet is not a network.  It&#039;s a software layer, and it spans several networks.
Many people say &quot;Usenet&quot; when they really mean UUCP.  You can post a message to
a Usenet newsgroup by mailing it to &quot;name@usenet&quot; at DECWRL.  For example,
mailing from VMS to this address:

    nm%DECWRL::&quot;alt.cyberpunk@usenet&quot;

causes the mail message to be posted as an article to the Usenet newsgroup
alt.cyberpunk.  It is better to use Usenet software for posting articles, as
more features are available that way, such as restricted distributions,
crossposting, and cancellation of &quot;wish I hadn&#039;t sent that&quot; articles.


MAILING TO BITNET

Legend has it that the &quot;BIT&quot; in BITNET stands for &quot;Because It&#039;s There&quot; or
&quot;Because It&#039;s Time.&quot;  It is a network consisting primarily of IBM computers.  A
native BITNET address is something like &quot;OMAR at STANFORD&quot;, but when translated
into our Internet format it becomes omar@stanford.bitnet.  Once translated into
Internet form, a BITNET address is used just like any other Internet address.


MAILING TO FIDONET

By comparison with the other linked networks, Fidonet has an addressing
complexity bordering on the bizarre.  The Fidonet people have provided me with
this description:

Each Fidonet node is a member of a &quot;network,&quot; and may have subsidiary nodes
called &quot;point nodes.&quot;  A typical Fido address is &quot;1:987/654&quot; or &quot;987/654&quot;; a
typical Fido &quot;point node&quot; address is &quot;1:987/654.32&quot; or &quot;987/654.32&quot;.  This is
zone 1, network 987, Fido (node) 654, &quot;point node&quot; 32.  If the zone number is
missing, assume it is zone 1.  The zone number must be supplied in the outgoing
message.

To send a message to Chris Jones on Fidonet address 1:987/654, use the address
Chris.Jones@f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org.  To send a message to Mark Smith at
Fidonet node 987/654.32, use address Mark.Smith@p32.f654.n987.z1.fidonet.org.
Use them just like any other Internet address.

Sometimes the return addresses on messages from Fidonet will look different.
You may or may not be able to reply to them.

Appendix:  List of UUCP Neighbor Sites

This table shows most of the sites that DECWRL dials directly via UUCP.  You
may find it useful to help you construct a UUCP route to a particular
destination.  Those sites marked with &quot;*&quot; are major UUCP routing nodes.  You
should prefer UUCP routes that use these sites as the first hop from DECWRL.
Case is significant in UUCP host names.

                     Volume Three, Issue 30, File #6 of 12

                   Decnet Hackola : Remote Turist TTY (RTT)
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

                           A Late-Night Creation Of

                                   *Hobbit*

This VMS network frob is yet another &quot;tell&quot;-type thing.  This one has an
uncommon feature though:  recursion (i.e. you can be connected to some host
and open *another* connection to a third host and it will [attempt to!] &quot;do the
right thing&quot;).  Also, you can ^Y out and if you run it again, it will return to
the open connection instead of starting a new one.

_H*


*************************************************************************
$! RTT -- Remote Turist TTY interface.  Do @RTT hostname or @RTT area.node
$! to start; this file must exist in the remote machine&#039;s default area.
$! You can ^Y out and the network channel will stick around; invoking RTT
$! again will resume the extant process and ignore arguments.
$! If we are a network object, play server, if not, we must be the client.
$! If we are called while already playing server, recurse to the end host.
$! This recursion in theory can happen infinite times.  Make damn sure
$! what you call this file and the &quot;task=&quot; spec jive, and that they are the
$! same file, or you will fall victim to very vicious timing screws.

                               VAX/VMS Fake Mail

                                by Jack T. Tab

                             =-------------------=


In the August 1986 issue of VAX PROFESSIONAL, the BASIC subroutine that appears
at the end of this text was published.  It was not until more than two years
later that DEC included a callable mail interface with VMS 5.x.  While the
official version is much more extensive, the routine included here has one
important feature.  The ability to have a mail message appear to be from
someone else is a good addition to most &quot;toolkits.&quot;

VMS Mail works in two manners.  The first is the familiar interactive.  The
second is as a network object.  In this method, MAIL is invoked by the
NETSERVER.COM command procedure in response to an incoming connect request.
MAIL.EXE is activated as network object 27.  The other network objects can be
viewed by using the NCP command SHOW KNOWN OBJECTS.  In this mode, MAIL.EXE
operates as a slave process, receiving instructions from the master process.
The master, in most cases, is another process running MAIL.EXE interactively.
The slave process can handle requests to deliver mail to as many recipients as
necessary.  Addresses that are not on the same node as the slave process are
forwarded by activating yet another slave process on the target node.  The
information sent by the master MAIL to the slave MAIL is quite simple and
straightforward, consisting of a series of strings.

The first string is for the FROM name.  This is what makes the subroutine
useful, as it can be anything (i.e. the_Easter_Bunny).  The next set of strings
are to whom the mail is to be sent.  One address per string, with a null
string, chr(0), terminating the list.  The third item is what the receiver(s)
sees in their TO: field.  This also can be anything.  VMS MAIL can use this
option for its .DIS distribution lists.  The final information is the body of
the message.  It too is terminated by another null string.  The subject of the
mail message is taken from the first line of this text.

The MAIL slave will send back appropriate status messages indicating problems
if they occur.  Such as &quot;Addressee Unknown&quot; or VMS and DECnet errors like &quot;Disk
Quota Exceeded&quot; or &quot;Remote Node Not Reachable&quot;).

The only privilege that seems necessary is NETMBX.  Without it the subroutine
cannot call MAIL as a network object.  Our beloved system management resolved
the problem of people pretending to be SYSTEM by installing MAIL with NETMBX
and removing the priv from the student accounts.  The subroutine works just as
well with JNET and BITNET as it does with DECNET addresses.

        &lt;&lt;===========================================================&gt;&gt;

More often than we realize, reality conspires to imitate art.  In the case of
the computer virus reality, the art is &quot;cyberpunk,&quot; a strangely compelling
genre of science fiction that has gained a cult following among hackers
operating on both sides of the law.  Books with titles like &quot;True Names,&quot;
&quot;Shockwave Rider,&quot; &quot;Neuromancer,&quot; &quot;Hard-wired,&quot; &quot;Wetware,&quot; and &quot;Mona Lisa
Overdrive,&quot; are shaping the realities of many would-be viral adepts.  Anyone
trying to make sense of the social culture surrounding viruses should add the
books to their reading list as well.

Cyberpunk got its name only a few years ago, but the genre can be traced back
to publication of John Brunner&#039;s &quot;Shockwave Rider&quot; in 1975.  Inspired by Alvin
Toffler&#039;s 1970 best-seller &quot;Future Shock,&quot; Brunner paints a distopian world of
the early 21st Century in which Toffler&#039;s most pessimistic visions have come to
pass.  Crime, pollution and poverty are rampant in overpopulated urban
arcologies.  An inconclusive nuclear exchange at the turn of the century has
turned the arms race into a brain race.  The novel&#039;s hero, Nickie Haflinger, is
rescued from a poor and parentless childhood and enrolled in a top secret
government think tank charged with training geniuses to work for a
military-industrial Big Brother locked in a struggle for global political
dominance.

It is also a world certain to fulfill the wildest fantasies of a 1970s phone
&quot;phreak.&quot;  A massive computerized data-net blankets North America, an
electronic super highway leading to every computer and every last bit of data
on every citizen and corporation in the country.  Privacy is a thing of the
past, and one&#039;s power and status is determined by his or her level of identity
code.  Haflinger turns out to be the ultimate phone phreak:  he discovers the
immorality of his governmental employers and escapes into society, relying on
virtuoso computer skills (and a stolen transcendental access code) to rewrite
his identity at will.  After six years on the run and on the verge of a
breakdown from input overload, he discovers a lost band of academic
techno-libertarians who shelter him in their ecologically sound California
commune and... well, you can guess the rest.

Brunner&#039;s book became a best-seller and remains in print.  It inspired a whole
generation of hackers including, apparently, Robert Morris, Jr. of Cornell
virus fame.  The Los Angeles Times reported that Morris&#039; mother identified
&quot;Shockwave Rider&quot; as &quot;her teen-age son&#039;s primer on computer viruses and one of
the most tattered books in young Morris&#039; room.&quot;  Though &quot;Shockwave Rider&quot; does
not use the term &quot;virus,&quot; Haflinger&#039;s key skill was the ability to write
&quot;tapeworms&quot; -- autonomous programs capable of infiltrating systems and
surviving eradication attempts by reassembling themselves from viral bits of
code hidden about in larger programs.  Parallels between Morris&#039; reality and
Brunner&#039;s art is not lost on fans of cyberpunk:  one junior high student I
spoke with has both a dog-eared copy of the book, and a picture of Morris taped
next to his computer.  For him, Morris is at once something of a folk hero and
a role model.

In &quot;Shockwave Rider,&quot; computer/human interactions occurred much as they do
today:  One logged in and relied on some combination of keyboard and screen to
interact with the machines.  In contrast, second generation cyberpunk offers
more exotic and direct forms of interaction.  Vernor Vinge&#039;s &quot;True Names&quot; was
the first novel to hint at something deeper.  In his story, and small band of
hackers manage to transcend the limitations of keyboard and screen, and
actually meet as presences in the network system.  Vinge&#039;s work found an
enthusiastic audience (including Marvin Minsky who wrote the afterword), but
never achieved the sort of circulation enjoyed by Brunner.  It would be another
author, a virtual computer illiterate, who would put cyberpunk on the map.

The author was William Gibson, who wrote &quot;Neuromancer&quot; in 1984 on a 1937 Hermes
portable typewriter.  Gone are keyboards; Gibson&#039;s characters jack directly
into Cyberspace, &quot;a consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of
legitimate operators... a graphic representation of data abstracted from the
banks of every computer in the human system.  Unthinkable complexity.  Lines of
light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of
data...&quot;

Just as Brunner offered us a future of the 1970s run riot, Gibson&#039;s
&quot;Neuromancer&quot; serves up the 1980s taken to their cultural and technological
extreme.  World power is in the hands of multinational &quot;zaibatsu,&quot; battling for
power much as mafia and yakuza gangs struggle for turf today.  It is a world of
organ transplants, biological computers and artificial intelligences.  Like
Brunner, it is a distopian vision of the future, but while Brunner evoked the
hardness of technology, Gibson calls up the gritty decadence evoked in the
movie &quot;Bladerunner,&quot; or of the William Burroughs novel, &quot;Naked Lunch&quot; (alleged
similarities between that novel and &quot;Neuromancer&quot; have triggered rumors that
Gibson plagiarized Burroughs).

Gibson&#039;s hero, Case, is a &quot;deck cowboy,&quot; a freelance corporate thief-for-hire
who projects his disembodied consciousness into the cyberspace matrix,
penetrating corporate systems to steal data for his employers.  It is a world
that Ivan Boesky would understand:  Corporate espionage and double-dealing has
become so much the norm that Case&#039;s acts seem less illegal than profoundly
ambiguous.

This ambiguity offers an interesting counterpoint to current events.  Much of
the controversy over the Cornell virus swirls around the legal and ethical
ambiguity of Morris&#039; act.  For every computer professional calling for Morris&#039;
head, another can be found praising him.  It is an ambiguity that makes the
very meaning of the word &quot;hacker&quot; a subject of frequent debate.

Morris&#039; apparently innocent error in no way matches the actions of Gibson&#039;s
characters, but a whole new generation of aspiring hackers may be learning
their code of ethics from Gibson&#039;s novels.  &quot;Neuromancer&quot; won three of science
fiction&#039;s most prestigious awards -- the Hugo, the Nebula and the Philip K.
Dick Memorial Award -- and continues to be a best-seller today.  Unambiguously
illegal and harmful acts of computer piracy such as those alleged against Kevin
Mitnick (arrested after a long and aggressive penetration of DEC&#039;s computers)
would fit right into the &quot;Neuromancer&quot; story line.

&quot;Neuromancer&quot; is the first book in a trilogy.  In the second volume, &quot;Count
Zero&quot; -- so-called after the code name of a character -- the cyberspace matrix
becomes sentient.  Typical of Gibson&#039;s literary elegance, this becomes apparent
through an artist&#039;s version of the Turing test.  Instead of holding an
intelligent conversation with a human, a node of the matrix on an abandoned
orbital factory begins making achingly beautiful and mysterious boxes -- a 21st
Century version of the work of the late artist, Joseph Cornell.  These works of
art begin appearing in the terrestrial marketplace, and a young woman art
dealer is hired by an unknown patron to track down the source.  Her search
intertwines with the fates of other characters, building to a conclusion equal
to the vividness and suspense of &quot;Neuromancer.&quot;  The third book, &quot;Mona Lisa
Overdrive&quot; answers many of the questions left hanging in the first book and
further completes the details of the world created by Gibson including an
adoption by the network of the personae of the pantheon of voodoo gods and
goddesses, worshipped by 21st Century Rastafarian hackers.

Hard core science fiction fans are notorious for identifying with the worlds
portrayed in their favorite books.  Visit any science fiction convention and
you can encounter amidst the majority of quite normal participants, small
minority of individuals who seem just a bit, well, strange.  The stereotypes of
individuals living out science fiction fantasies in introverted solitude has
more than a slight basis in fact.  Closet Dr. Whos or Warrior Monks from &quot;Star
Wars&quot; are not uncommon in Silicon Valley; I was once startled to discover over
lunch that a programmer holding a significant position in a prominent company
considered herself to be a wizardess in the literal sense of the term.

Identification with cyberpunk at this sort of level seems to be becoming more
and more common.  Warrior Monks may have trouble conjuring up Imperial
Stormtroopers to do battle with, but aspiring deck jockeys can log into a
variety of computer systems as invited or (if they are good enough) uninvited
guests.  One individual I spoke with explained that viruses held a special
appeal to him because it offered a means of &quot;leaving an active alter ego
presence on the system even when I wasn&#039;t logged in.&quot;  In short, it was the
first step toward experiencing cyberspace.

Gibson apparently is leaving cyberpunk behind, but the number of books in the
genre continues to grow.  Not mentioned here are a number of other authors such
as Rudy Rucker (considered by many to be the father of cyberpunk) and Walter
John Williams who offer similar visions of a future networked world inhabited
by human/computer symbionts.  In addition, at least one magazine, &quot;Reality
Hackers&quot; (formerly &quot;High Frontiers Magazine&quot; of drug fame) is exploring the
same general territory with a Chinese menu offering of tongue-in-cheek
paranoia, ambient music reviews, cyberdelia (contributor Timothy Leary&#039;s term)
and new age philosophy.

The growing body of material is by no means inspiration for every aspiring
digital alchemist.  I am particularly struck by the &quot;generation gap&quot; in the
computer community when it comes to &quot;Neuromancer&quot;:  Virtually every teenage
hacker I spoke with has the book, but almost none of my friends over 30 have
picked it up.

Similarly, not every cyberpunk fan is a potential network criminal; plenty of
people read detective thrillers without indulging in the desire to rob banks.
But there is little doubt that a small minority of computer artists are finding
cyberpunk an important inspiration in their efforts to create an exceedingly
strange computer reality.  Anyone seeking to understand how that reality is
likely to come to pass would do well to pick up a cyberpunk novel or two.

Americans love gadgets, so it is not hard to explain the popularity of the lie
detector.  Many people believe in the validity of lie detectors because the
instruments and printouts resemble those used by doctors and others who collect
scientific data and because lie detectors are simple, convenient shortcuts to
hard complicated decisions.  Polygraphy is fast becoming an American obsession
-- an obsession, incidentally, not shared by the British or the Europeans or,
as far as we know, the Russians.

American industry&#039;s increasing dependence on the polygraph reflects an enormous
faith in the rational processes of science.  Each of us can recall a time when
our voices sounded funny as we told a lie.  Surely, if we can &quot;hear&quot; a lie,
science can detect one.  It comes as a disturbing shock, therefore, to learn
how fragile the polygraph&#039;s scientific foundations really are.

The roots of the lie detector, more formally known as the polygraph, go back to
the turn of the century, when infatuation with the newly discovered powers of
electricity more than once overcame common sense.  But whereas electric hair
restorers and high-voltage cancer cures have all but vanished, the polygraph
persists and even flourishes.  According to the best estimates, over one
million polygraph examinations are administered each year in the united States.
They are used in criminal investigations, during government security checks,
and increasingly by nervous employers -- particularly banks and stores.  In
certain parts of the country, a woman must pass a lie detector test before the
authorities will prosecute a rape.  In 1983 the television show Lie Detector
added the dimension of home entertainment to polygraph tests.

The National Security Agency (NSA) leads the roster of federal polygraph users;
both it and the CIA rely heavily on polygraph testing for pre-employment and
routine security screening.  The NSA reported giving nearly 10,000 tests in
1982 (CIA numbers are classified).  Those who are labeled &quot;deceptive&quot; often
lose their jobs, even if there is no actual evidence against them.  Moreover,
the polygraph report may become a permanent part of an employee&#039;s records, and
it will be extremely difficult to compel a correction.

With the arrest in June 1985 of four Navy men on espionage charges, the issue
of using polygraphs to uncover spies or ferret out dishonest job seekers has
come to the forefront of the debate about what should be done to stem the loss
of defense and company secrets and to dispel potential thieves in the
workplace.

Much the same issue is at the heart of the protracted wrangle between the
Reagan Administration and Congress over plans for expanded government use of
the polygraph.  An executive order issued on March 11, 1983, known as National
Security Decision Directive 84, would have sanctioned for the first time
&quot;adverse consequences&quot; for a federal employee who refuses to take a test when
asked.  The directive authorized tests to investigate candidates for certain
security clearances and to ask any federal employee about leaks of classified
information.  (This directive was issued shortly after Reagan&#039;s comment about
being &quot;up to my keister&quot; in press leads.)  Almost simultaneously the Department
of Defense (DOD) released a draft regulation that authorized use of the
polygraph to screen employees who take on sensitive intelligence assignments;
it, too, prescribed adverse consequences for refusal.

Critics of the polygraph maintain that its use represents an invasion of
privacy, especially when the coercive power of the government or an employer is
behind the application.  It is hard for a job applicant to say no when a
prospective employer asks him or her to take a polygraph test; once hooked up
to the machine, the applicant may face questions not only about past criminal
activity but also about matters that an employer may have no business intruding
upon, such as sexual practices or gambling -- questions asked ostensibly to
assess the applicant&#039;s &quot;character.&quot;  As a result of such abuses, nineteen
states and the District of Columbia have made it illegal for an organization to
ask its employees to take polygraph examinations.

A question more basic than whether the polygraph is an unacceptable invasion of
privacy is, of course, whether it works.  Seeking an answer in the scientific
literature can be a bewildering experience.  A report by the Office of
Technology Assessment (OTA), commissioned in 1983 by Brooks&#039;s Committee on
Government Operations, summed up the problem by citing twenty-four studies that
found correct detection of guilt ranging from 35% to 100%.

Polygraph theory thrives on a sort of Pinocchio vision of lying, in which
physiological reactions -- changes in blood pressure or rate of breathing or
sweating of the palms -- elicited by a set of questions will reliably betray
falsehood.  Lying, goes the rationale, is deliberate, and the knowledge and
effort associated with it will make a person upset enough to display a physical
reaction like a speedup of the heartbeat.  The variables measured usually
include the galvanic skin response (GSR), blood pressure, abdominal
respiration, and thoracic respiration.  The GSR is measured by fingertip
electrodes that produce changes in the electrical resistance in the palms when
they are sweating.  The blood pressure and pulse are monitored through a system
that uses a sphygmomanometer cuff, which is usually attached to the biceps
(this is similar to the way doctors measure blood pressure).  There is no
&quot;specific lie response.&quot;  The polygraph merely records general emotional
arousal.  It does not distinguish anxiety or indignation from guilt.  The real
&quot;lie detector&quot; is the operator, who interprets the various body responses on
the machine&#039;s output.

Polygraphers claim that it is the form and mix of questions that are the keys
to their success.  The standard format, known as the Control Question Test,
involves interspersing &quot;relevant&quot; questions with &quot;control&quot; questions.  Relevant
questions relate directly to the critical matter:  &quot;Did you participate in the
robbery of the First National Bank on September 11, 1981?&quot;  Control questions,
on the other hand, are less precise:  &quot;In the last twenty years, have you ever
taken something that did not belong to you?&quot;

In the pretest interview, the polygrapher reviews all the questions and frames
the control questions to produce &quot;no&quot; answers.  It is in this crucial pretest
phase that the polygrapher&#039;s deception comes into play, for he wants the
innocent subject to dissemble while answering the control questions during the
actual test.

The assumption underlying the Control Question Test is that the truthful
subject will display a stronger physiological reaction to the control
questions, whereas a deceptive subject will react more strongly to the relevant
questions.  That is the heart of it.  Modern lie detection relies on nothing
more than subtle psychological techniques, crude physiological indicators, and
skilled questioning and interpretation of the results.

Critics claim that polygraphy fails to take the complexities of lying into
account.  For some people lying can be satisfying, fulfilling, exciting, and
even humorous, depending on their reasons for lying.  Other people feel little
or no emotion when lying.  Still others believe their lies and think they are
telling the truth when they are not.  Moreover, the theory holds that deception
produces distinctive physiological changes that characterize lying and only
lying.  This notion has no empirical support.  Quite the contrary:  Lying
produces no known distinctive pattern of physiological activity.

Undeniably, when being dishonest, people can feel great turmoil and a polygraph
can measure this turmoil.  But when apprehensive about being interrogated, they
can give a similar emotional reaction:  When they think they are losing the
chance for job openings or their jobs are on the line, when they reflect on the
judgements that could be made about their answers, or, for that matter, when
they are angry, puzzled, or even amused by the impertinent probing of a total
stranger.  Some control questions may make a person appear guilty.  Such
questions may force a subject into a minor lie or ask about an invented crime
that nonetheless makes the subject nervous.

Lie detectors are especially unreliable for truthful people.  Many more
innocent people test as &quot;deceptive&quot; than guilty people test as &quot;innocent.&quot;
Those who run a special risk include people who get upset if someone accuses
them of something they didn&#039;t do, people with short tempers, people who tend to
feel guilty anyway, and people not accustomed to having their word questioned.
All of these feelings can change heart rate, breathing, and perspiration and
their heightened feelings are easily confused with guilt.

It has also been shown that polygraphs are easily manipulated.  Four hundred
milligrams of the tranquilizer meprobamate taken an hour or two before a
polygraph session can make it virtually impossible to spot a liar by his
physiological responses.  In fact, some researchers even argue that an examinee
can use simple countermeasures, such as biting one&#039;s tongue, gouging oneself
with a fingernail, or stepping on a nail concealed in a shoe, to fake a strong
reaction to the control questions, thus &quot;beating&quot; the test.  According to one
researcher, one prison inmate, who became the jail-house polygraph expert after
studying the literature, trained twenty-seven fellow inmates in the seat
techniques; twenty-three beat the polygraph tests used tons investigate
violations of prison rules.  However, do not try sighing, coughing, or
clenching your fist or arm.  Polygraphers usually are suspicious of those
techniques and may label you &quot;deceptive&quot; for that reason alone.

It should be obvious that the interpretation of the results of any polygraph
test will certainly be very difficult.  Also, not all responses on the machine
will agree.  What are the present qualifications for a polygrapher?  Most of
the twenty-five or more schools that train examiners provide only an eight-week
course of instruction and require two years of college for admission.  This is
about one-sixth the study time of the average barber college.  Perhaps as many
as a dozendy time of contemporary polygraphers do hold Ph.D&#039;s, but the vast
majority of the 4,000 to 8,000 practicing examiners had no simple significant
training in physiology or in psychology, even though lie detection demands
extremely subtle and difficult psychophysiological interpretations.  There are
no licensing standards for polygraph operators, and, with so many poorly, who
trained operators, thousands of tests are conducted hastily and haphazardly,
resulting in highly questionable accuracy.  For many innocent people, their
judge and jury are these unskilled operators.

Honesty is also difficult to predict because it tends to be situation-
specific.  Therefore, it is more dependent on motivation and opportunity than
on some personality trait.  As Bertrand Russell once said, &quot;Virtue is dictated
by results of circumstance.&quot;

Proponents of the polygraph sometimes cite &quot;correct guilty detections&quot;:  The
percentage of guilty subjects who are caught by the polygraph.  This figure can
be very impressive:  In one study that does not suffer from the failings
already mentioned, it was 98% correct.  But the same study found that 55% of
innocent subjects were also diagnosed as &quot;deceptive.&quot;  The handful of studies
that used a truly random selection of cases and scored them blind produced
similar results:  Overall, 83% of guilty subjects were diagnosed as
&quot;deceptive,&quot; as were 43% of innocent subjects.  It&#039;s no trick to push the rate
of correct guilty detections to 100% -- just call everyone &quot;deceptive.&quot;  You
don&#039;t even need a machine to do that!

Nature published its conclusions last year.  Their aggregated findings were
based on the polygraph charts of 207 criminal suspects, which 14 polygraphers
scored independently.  On the average, they erroneously diagnosed 43% of
innocent suspects as deceptive. Such errors, called false positives, ranged as
high as 50%.  The corresponding errors of deceptive persons &quot;passing the test,&quot;
or false negatives, were as high as 36%.

The accuracy rates of &quot;failed&quot; and &quot;passed&quot; depend, of course, on the
proportion of dishonest persons in the group tested.  Thus, if 800 of 1,000
persons tested are truthful, a test that is 72% accurate overall will accuse
144 liars and 224 truthful persons.  This is not an impressive accuracy record.

These numbers suggest that the polygraph test is biased against innocent
people.  The problem is accentuated when the test is used in the screening
situations envisioned in the Reagan Administration proposals (and already
established at the NSA and the CIA).  Everyone is tested, but presumably only a
very small proportion has done anything wrong.  If we assume that one employee
in a hundred is a spy (probably a gross overestimate), and if we use the 83%
correct-guilty-detection rate, we find that 51 innocent persons will flunk the
polygraph test for every real spy who flunks.  Any test, whether it is for
truth or for cancer, has to be extremely accurate to detect a rare phenomenon
without setting off a lot of false alarms in the process.  Even if the test
were 99% accurate for both guilty and innocent detections, one innocent person
would be falsely branded for each spy caught.  Because of this &quot;case rate&quot;
problem, the FBI forbids the use of polygraph dragnets:  The tests can be used
only after an initial investigation has narrowed the field of suspects.

Given all the doubts about their validity, why does the government persist in
using polygraph tests?  Some clues are found in the DOD 1983 report on
polygraph testing -- even in its title, &quot;The Accuracy and Utility of Polygraph
Testing&quot; which suggests that accuracy and utility are two different things.
The most that report concludes about accuracy is that it is &quot;significantly
above chance.&quot;  Utility, however, is quite another matter.  Perhaps the most
telling statement about lie detectors comes from former president Nixon, who
declared on one of the White House tapes, &quot;I don&#039;t know anything about lie
detectors other than they scare the hell out of people.&quot;

         &quot;Until a few years ago -- maybe ten -- it was very common to
          see TWX and Telex machines in almost every business place.&quot;

There were only minor differences between Telex and TWX.  The biggest
difference was that the former was always run by Western Union, while the
latter was run by the Bell System for a number of years.  TWX literally meant
&quot;(T)ype(W)riter e(x)change,&quot; and it was Bell&#039;s answer to competition from
Western Union.  There were &quot;three row&quot; and &quot;four row&quot; machines, meaning the
number of keys on the keyboard and how they were laid out.  The &quot;three row&quot;
machines were simply part of the regular phone network; that is, they could
dial out and talk to another TWX also connected on regular phone lines.

Eventually these were phased out in favor of &quot;newer and more improved&quot; machines
with additional keys, as well as a paper tape reader attachment which allowed
sending the same message repeatedly to many different machines.  These &quot;four
row&quot; machines were not on the regular phone network, but were assigned their
own area codes (410-510-610-710-810-910) where they still remain today.  The
only way a four row machine could call a three row machine or vice-versa was
through a gateway of sorts which translated some of the character set unique to
each machine.

Western Union&#039;s network was called Telex and in addition to being able to
contact (by dial up) other similar machines, Telex could connect with TWX (and
vice-versa) as well as all the Western Union public offices around the country.
Until the late 1950&#039;s or early 1960&#039;s, every small town in America had a
Western Union office.  Big cities like Chicago had perhaps a dozen of them, and
they used messengers to hand deliver telegrams around town.  Telegrams could be
placed in person at any public office, or could be called in to the nearest
public office.

By arrangement with most telcos, the Western Union office in town nearly always
had the phone number 4321, later supplemented in automated exchanges with some
prefix XXX-4321.  Telegrams could be charged to your home phone bill (this is
still the case in some communities) and from a coin phone, one did not ask for
4321, but rather, called the operator and asked for Western Union.  This was
necessary since once the telegram had been given verbally to the wire clerk,
s/he in turn had to flash the hook and get your operator back on the line to
tell them &quot;collect five dollars and twenty cents&quot; or whatever the cost was.
Telegrams, like phone calls, could be sent collect or billed third party.  If
you had an account with Western Union, i.e. a Telex machine in your office, you
could charge the calls there, but most likely you would simply send the
telegram from there in the first place.

Sometime in the early 1960&#039;s, Western Union filed suit against AT&amp;T asking that
they turn over their TWX business to them.  They cited an earlier court ruling,
circa 1950&#039;s, which said AT&amp;T was prohibited from acquiring any more telephone
operating companies except under certain conditions.  The Supreme Court agreed
with Western Union that &quot;spoken messages&quot; were the domain of Ma Bell, but
&quot;written messages&quot; were the domain of Western Union.  So Bell was required to
divest itself of the TWX network, and Western Union has operated it since,
although a few years ago they began phasing out the phrase &quot;TWX&quot; in favor of
&quot;Telex II&quot;; their original device being &quot;Telex I&quot; of course.  TWX still uses
ten digit dialing with 610 (Canada) or 710/910 (USA) being the leading three
digits.  Apparently 410-510 have been abandoned; or at least they are used very
little, and Bellcore has assigned 510 to the San Francisco area starting in a
year or so.  410 still has some funny things on it, like the Western Union
&quot;Infomaster,&quot; which is a computer that functions like a gateway between Telex,
TWX, EasyLink and some other stuff.

Today, the Western Union network is but a skeleton of its former self.  Now
most of their messages are handled on dial up terminals connected to the public
phone network.  It has been estimated the TWX/Telex business is about fifty
percent of what it was a decade ago, if that much.

Then there was the Time Service, a neat thing which Western Union offered for
over seventy years, until it was discontinued in the middle 1960&#039;s.  The Time
Service provided an important function in the days before alternating current
was commonly available.  For example, Chicago didn&#039;t have AC electricity until
about 1945.  Prior to that we used DC, or direct current.

Well, to run an electric clock, you need 60 cycles AC current for obvious
reasons, so prior to the conversion from DC power to AC power, electric wall
clocks such as you see in every office were unheard of.  How were people to
tell the time of day accurately?  Enter the Western Union clock.

The Western Union, or &quot;telegraph clock&quot; was a spring driven wind up clock, but
with a difference.  The clocks were &quot;perpetually self-winding,&quot; manufactured by
the Self-Winding Clock Company of New York City.  They had large batteries
inside them, known as &quot;telephone cells&quot; which had a life of about ten years
each.  A mechanical contrivance in the clock would rotate as the clock spring
unwound, and once each hour would cause two metal clips to contact for about
ten seconds, which would pass juice to the little motor in the clock which in
turn re-wound the main spring.  The principle was the same as the battery
operated clocks we see today.  The battery does not actually run the clock --
direct current can&#039;t do that -- but it does power the tiny motor which re-winds
the spring which actually drives the clock.

The Western Union clocks came in various sizes and shapes, ranging from the
smallest dials which were nine inches in diameter to the largest which were
about eighteen inches in diameter.  Some had sweep second hands; others did
not.  Some had a little red light bulb on the front which would flash.  The
typical model was about sixteen inches, and was found in offices, schools,
transportation depots, radio station offices, and of course in the telegraph
office itself.

The one thing all the clocks had in common was their brown metal case and
cream-colored face, with the insignia &quot;Western Union&quot; and their corporate logo
in those days which was a bolt of electricity, sort of like a letter &quot;Z&quot; laying
on its side.  And in somewhat smaller print below, the words &quot;Naval Observatory
Time.&quot;

The local clocks in an office or school or wherever were calibrated by a
&quot;master clock&quot; (actually a sub-master) on the premises.  Once an hour on the
hour, the (sub) master clock would drop a metal contact for just a half second,
and send about nine volts DC up the line to all the local clocks.  They in turn
had a &quot;tolerance&quot; of about two minutes on both sides of the hour so that the
current coming to them would yank the minute hand exactly upright onto the
twelve from either direction if the clock was fast or slow.

The sub-master clocks in each building were in turn serviced by the master
clock in town; usually this was the one in the telegraph office.  Every hour on
the half hour, the master clock in the telegraph office would throw current to
the sub-masters, yanking them into synch as required.  And as for the telegraph
offices themselves, they were serviced twice a day by -- you guessed it -- the
Naval Observatory Master clock in Our Nation&#039;s Capitol, by the same routine.
Someone there would press half a dozen buttons at the same time, using all
available fingers; current would flow to every telegraph office and synch all
the master clocks in every community.  Western Union charged fifty cents per
month for the service, and tossed the clock in for free!  Oh yes, there was an
installation charge of about two dollars when you first had service (i.e. a
clock) installed.

The clocks were installed and maintained by the &quot;clockman,&quot; a technician from
Western Union who spent his day going around hanging new clocks, taking them
out of service, changing batteries every few years for each clock, etc.

What a panic it was for them when &quot;war time&quot; (what we now call Daylight Savings
Time) came around each year!  Wally, the guy who serviced all the clocks in
downtown Chicago had to start on *Thursday* before the Sunday official
changeover just to finish them all by *Tuesday* following.  He would literally
rush in an office, use his screwdriver to open the case, twirl the hour hand
around one hour forward in the spring, (or eleven hours *forward* in the fall
since the hands could not be moved backward beyond the twelve going
counterclockwise), slam the case back on, screw it in, and move down the hall
to the next clock and repeat the process.  He could finish several dozen clocks
per day, and usually the office assigned him a helper twice a year for these
events.

He said they never bothered to line the minute hand up just right, because it
would have taken too long, and &quot;.....anyway, as long as we got it within a
minute or so, it would synch itself the next time the master clock sent a
signal...&quot;  Working fast, it took a minute to a minute and a half to open the
case, twirl the minute hand, put the case back on, &quot;stop and b.s. with the
receptionist for a couple seconds&quot; and move along.

The master clock sent its signal over regular telco phone lines.  Usually it
would terminate in the main office of whatever place it was, and the (sub)
master there would take over at that point.

Wally said it was very important to do a professional job of hanging the clock
to begin with.  It had to be level, and the pendulum had to be just right,
otherwise the clock would gain or lose more time than could be accommodated in
the hourly synching process.  He said it was a very rare clock that actually
was out by even a minute once an hour, let alone the two minutes of tolerance
built into the gear works.

     &quot;...Sometimes I would come to work on Monday morning, and find out
     in the office that the clock line had gone open Friday evening.  So
     nobody all weekend got a signal.  Usually I would go down a manhole
     and find it open someplace where one of the Bell guys messed it up,
     or took it off and never put it back on.  To find out where it was
     open, someone in the office would &#039;ring out&#039; the line; I&#039;d go around
     downtown following the loop as we had it laid out, and keep listening
     on my headset for it.  When I found the break or the open, I would
     tie it down again and the office would release the line; but then I
     had to go to all the clocks *before* that point and restart them,
     since the constant current from the office during the search had
     usually caused them to stop.&quot;

But he said, time and again, the clocks were usually so well mounted and hung
that &quot;...it was rare we would find one so far out of synch that we had to
adjust it manually.  Usually the first signal to make it through once I
repaired the circuit would yank everyone in town to make up for whatever they
lost or gained over the weekend...&quot;

In 1965, Western Union decided to discontinue the Time Service.  In a nostalgic
letter to subscribers, they announced their decision to suspend operations at
the end of the current month, but said &quot;for old time&#039;s sake&quot; anyone who had a
clock was welcome to keep it and continue using it; there just would not be any
setting signals from the master clocks any longer.

Within a day or two of the official announcement, every Western Union clock in
the Chicago area headquarters building was gone.  The executives snatched them
off the wall, and took them home for the day when they would have historical
value.  All the clocks in the telegraph offices disappeared about the same
time, to be replaced with standard office-style electric wall clocks.

Mitnick&#039;s Partner Gets Community Service                      November 29, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
By Kathy McDonald (New York Times)

    &quot;Man Sentenced To Community Service For Helping Steal Computer Program&quot;

LOS ANGELES -- A federal judge has sentenced a 24-year-old suburban Calabasas
man to community service at a homeless shelter for his role in helping computer
hacker Kevin Mitnick steal a computer security program.

In rejecting a sentencing report that suggested a prison term, U.S. District
Judge Mariana Pfaelzer noted that Leonard Mitchell DiCicco had voluntarily
notified authorities of the computer hacking.

&quot;I think you can do some good&quot; in the community by using his computer skills
productively, Pfaelzer told DiCicco.

She sentenced DiCicco to five years of probation, during which he must complete
750 hours of community service through the Foundation for People, a Los Angeles
group that matches probationers with community service projects.

DiCicco was assigned to develop a computer system for the Anaheim Interfaith
Shelter, said Frances Dohn, a foundation official.

DiCicco also was ordered to pay $12,000 in restitution to Digital Equipment
Corporation of Massachusetts, from which Mitnick stole a computer security
program.

Assistant U.S. Attorney James Asperger agreed with the community service
sentence, saying DiCicco&#039;s cooperation had been crucial in the case against
Mitnick.

DiCicco reported Mitnick to DEC officers.  Mitnick later admitted he stole the
program and electronically brought it to California.

DiCicco pleaded guilty in July to one count of aiding and abetting the
interstate transportation of stolen property.  He admitted that in 1987 he let
Mitnick, age 25, of suburban Panorama City, use his office computer at
Voluntary Plan Administrators in Calabasas to break into the DEC system.

Mitnick pleaded guilty and was sentenced in July to one year in prison and six
months in a community treatment program aimed at breaking his &quot;addiction&quot; to
computer hacking.

Under a plea bargain agreement with the government, DiCicco pleaded guilty in
July in exchange for a promise that he would not be prosecuted for any of the
other instances of computer hacking he and Mitnick carried out.

Phonavision At The University of California                    October 15, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken From the New York Times

CALIFORNIA -- Students at two campuses of the University of California, at
Berkeley and Los Angeles, have become the test market for a new public
video-telephone booth called Phonavision.

Its developers claim that it is the world&#039;s first video telephone for the
general public.

Each of the campuses has one of the large, silver-color phone booths in its
student union.  Phonavision opened on October 9, for a week of free
demonstrations.  Starting October 16, video phone calls from one campus to the
other will cost $10 for three minutes.

&quot;We view all this semester as a test,&quot; said Stephen Strickland, chief executive
officer of the Los Angeles-based company, Communications Technologies, that
developed the video phones.  &quot;We want to be sure that when we do go to market
with this service, it&#039;s as good as it can be.&quot;

&quot;We feel we&#039;re probably six months to a year away from having a system that we
can go out and market,&quot; Strickland said.  &quot;I see them in airport lobbies, hotel
lobbies, shopping centers, indoor high-traffic locations.&quot;  Video telephones
are already widely used in business, he added.

Phonavision callers speak to each other on standard telephone receivers.

A snapshot-size image of their own face is projected on one half of a small
screen, and the other half shows a picture of the person to whom they are
talking.

As a caller talks, the video screen shows small movements of the mouth or face.
But sudden movements mean a distorted picture.

With a tilt of a caller&#039;s head, for example, the image will move to the side in
separate parts, starting with the top of the head and moving down in a wavelike
motion.

Annalee Andres, a sophomore from Santa Ana, California, who has not yet
selected a major, was one of the first students to try out Berkeley&#039;s new video
phone.  She and her friends crowded around the phone booth in the Martin Luther
King Jr. Student Center, taking turns talking to a student from UCLA.

&quot;I think it has a long way to go yet, but it&#039;s really cool,&quot; she said.  &quot;I can
really see where it&#039;s leading.&quot;

Ms. Andres speculated on the effects that widespread use of video phones would
have.  &quot;What if they catch you and you&#039;re just out of the shower?&quot; she asked.
&quot;It&#039;ll change dating.&quot;

Daniel Ciruli, a junior from Tucson, Arizona, majoring in computer science, was
enthusiastic about his trial session, but he said the fee would keep him away
in the future.

&quot;It&#039;s a new toy,&quot; he said.  &quot;But at $10 for three minutes, with only one other
Phonavision, it&#039;s not going to be something that students are beating down the
door to use.&quot;

The video phone booth offers other services:  Recording and dealing in
videotapes and a place to send and receive fax messages.  The booth accepts $1,
$5, $10 and $20 bills, as well as Mastercard and Visa.

Gary Li, a senior from Beijing, who is majoring in electrical engineering,
started setting up Berkeley&#039;s phone booth in April.  Since then he has spent
about 20 hours a week repairing kinks in the system.

Berkeley and UCLA were chosen as tryout spots for the new service because most
students know somebody at the other campus, said Strickland, the company&#039;s
chief executive.

&quot;That&#039;s a place where we can get novelty use,&quot; he said, adding that &quot;Berkeley
and UCLA have a reputation for being front-runner schools -- places that are
innovative, that like new technology.&quot;

Strickland said his company has spent almost three years developing
Phonavision.  He would not disclose total costs, but priced the video phone
booths at $50,000 each.

The Omnipresent Telephone                                      October 10, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from The New York Times

Whatever the psychological implications, new technology has clearly made the
phone more omnipresent.  More calls are generated because of answering
machines, now owned by 28 percent of the nation&#039;s households, according to the
Electronic Industries Association.  People who use them say they make and
receive more calls because of them.

&quot;In olden days you would just miss the call,&quot; said Michael Beglin, a
businessman in Nashville.

Jill Goodman, an art dealer in New York, says she talks on the phone so often
that &quot;I&#039;m tortured about it, teased and insulted.&quot;  She uses the phone to
socialize, shop and check in with people she wants to stay in touch with but
does not want to take the time to see.

&quot;I have two lines in the country, two lines at home in the city and three lines
in my office, if that gives you any idea of how much phone I can generate,&quot; she
said.

A month ago, after resisting initially, she decided to have a car phone
installed.  &quot;I thought it might be nice to have a couple of hours without being
reachable,&quot; she said.  &quot;But I didn&#039;t like not being able to reach when I wanted
to.&quot;

Increasingly, too, people are using the phone to get services, information and
products.

The 900 numbers, which require callers to pay the cost, and the 800 numbers,
paid for by the calls&#039; recipients, are growing quickly.

Sprint Gateways started a new 900 service in May that already has 250 lines.
Callers can get wrestling trivia, financial updates, real-estate information
and a host of other data.  They can even play a version of &quot;Family Feud,&quot; which
receives as many as 7,000 calls a day, said Adrian Toader, the director of
sales and marketing.

Telephone shopping through 800 numbers continues to grow, too.  In 1986, L.L.
Bean, the Freeport, Maine, retailer, received 60 percent of its orders by
telephone and 40 percent by mail; by 1988, telephone orders had risen to 70
percent.  Like an increasing number of retailers, L.L. Bean allows customers to
call in their orders 24 hours a day.

But callers to 800 numbers often want more than a new shirt or sweater.

Susan Dilworth, who takes telephone orders for L.L. Bean, said, &quot;A lot of
people call and say:  &#039;I&#039;m coming to New England for the first time.  How
should I dress?&#039;&quot;  Other callers order merchandise but then begin talking about
their personal lives.  &quot;I think they&#039;re lonely,&quot; Mrs. Dilworth said.

Indeed, these anonymous but personal contacts are so popular that some people
are becoming hooked.

Marilyn Ng-A-Qui, the acting executive director of the New York City Self-Help
Clearinghouse, said one man called looking for help because he had run up a
$5,000 bill calling 900 numbers.  &quot;It is emerging as a problem all over the
country,&quot; she said.

Despite the deluge of telephone conversation, there are holdouts.  Lois Korey,
a partner in a New York advertising agency, writes letters whenever she can,
often suggesting lunch meetings.  &quot;I really like to see who I&#039;m talking to,&quot;
she said.

But even her partner, Allen Kay, calls her from his office just four feet away.
The only time he could not telephone, Mrs. Korey said, was when he was in his
car.  And now those days are over.  &quot;He got a car phone a month ago, and he
calls all the time,&quot; she said.  &quot;When I sit in the front seat of his car, I try
to step on it.&quot;

Higher Phone Rates For Modem Users                            November 26, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Material gathered from an Apple digest on Usenet)

A new regulation that the FCC is quietly working on will directly affect you as
the user of a computer and modem.  The FCC proposes that users of modems should
pay extra charges for use of the public telephone network which carry their
data.

In addition, computer network services such as CompuServe, Tymnet, &amp; Telenet
would also be charged as much as $6.00 per hour per user for use of the public
telephone network.  These charges would very likely be passed on to the
subscribers.

The money is to be collected and given to the telephone company in an effort to
raise funds lost to deregulation.

Jim Eason of KGO newstalk radio (San Francisco, California) commented on the
proposal during his afternoon radio program during which, he said he learned of
the new legislation in an article in the New York Times.  Jim took the time to
gather the addresses which are given below.

It is important that you act now.  The bureaucrats already have it in there
mind that modem users should subsidize the phone company and are now listening
to public comment.  Please stand up and make it clear that we will not stand
for any government restriction on the free exchange of information.

The people to write to about this situation are:

Chairman of the FCC

Washington, D.C. 20554

Chairman, Senate Communication Subcommittee
SH-227 Hart Building
Washington, D.C. 20510

Here is a sample letter:

Dear Sir,
     Please allow me to express my displeasure with the FCC proposal which
would authorize a surcharge for the use of modems on the telephone network.
This regulation is nothing less than an attempt to restrict the free exchange
of information among the growing number of computer users.  Calls placed using
modems require no special telephone company equipment, and users of modems pay
the phone company for use of the network in the form of a monthly bill.  In
short, a modem call is the same as a voice call and therefore should not be
subject to any additional regulation.

FCC Orders Refunds to Long-Distance Companies                 November 30, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from Associated Press

WASHINGTON -- Local telephone companies may have to refund as much as $75
million to long-distance companies and large private-line business customers,
the Federal Communications Commission says.

Pacific Northwest Bell in Idaho is one of the 15 companies named.  The local
phone companies accumulated overcharges between 1985 and 1988 under FCC
guidelines that allowed prices of these high capacity private-line services to
exceed the phone companies&#039; costs of providing the services.

The FCC ordered a refund as it considered challenges to the special pricing
scheme, which the local phone companies provide for long-distance companies or
large business customers.  The commission voted 4-0 that the scheme was legal
during the 1985-88 period, when the high prices were designed to keep too many
customers from switching from the regular public network to private lines, but
that market conditions no longer justify continuation of the special pricing.
The commission said it expects the local phone companies to refrain from
requesting such special prices in the future.

While examining the challenges to the special pricing scheme, the commission
said it found that local phone companies in some cases had charged more than
allowed under the commission&#039;s guidelines.  Therefore, the companies must
refund those charges, which could amount to as much as $75 million, the
commission said.  The FCC said the amount of the refunds will not be known
until the local phone companies file detailed reports with the commission.  The
companies have 40 days to make their filings.

The companies found not to be in compliance with the commission&#039;s pricing
guidelines from October 1, 1985 to December 31, 1986 were:

-  Diamond State
-  South Central Bell in Alabama
-  Southwestern Bell in Missouri and Oklahoma
-  Northwestern Bell in Iowa, Minnesota, Nebraska, and North Dakota
-  Pacific Northwest Bell in Idaho

Pacific Northwest Bell is now called U.S. West Communications and is the phone
company that serves most Seattle-area residents.

Companies found not complying from January 1, 1987 to December 31, 1988 were:

-  Ohio Bell
-  Wisconsin Bell
-  Southern Bell in North Carolina and South Carolina
-  South Central Bell in Mississippi and Tennessee
-  Pacific Bell
-  Nevada Bell
-  Southwestern Bell
-  Mountain Bell
-  Northwestern Bell
-  Cincinnati Bell

AT&amp;T v. Intellicall:  Another Lawsuit                          November 8, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dallas -- AT&amp;T filed a lawsuit charging that a Texas-based corporation equips
its pay telephones to illegally obtain billing information owned by AT&amp;T.

The lawsuit asks for $2 million in punitive damages and an undetermined amount
in actual damages from Intellicall Inc., headquartered in Carrollton, Texas.
It also asks the U.S. District Court in Dallas to order Intellicall to stop its
unauthorized use of AT&amp;T billing information.

At issue is how Intellicall pay phones determine the validity of calling card
numbers for billing purposes.  AT&amp;T contends that Intellicall pay phones are
designed and programmed by Intellicall to reach into and obtain the information
directly from AT&amp;T&#039;s card validation system.

That system, called Billing Validation Application (BVA), is a part of AT&amp;T&#039;s
network facilities.  Before AT&amp;T completes a call that will be charged to an
AT&amp;T Card, its validation system verifies that the number provided by the
customer is currently valid.

Based on contractual arrangements made before the 1984 breakup of the Bell
System, regional Bell telephone companies also use the validation system.  AT&amp;T
does not permit competitors such as Intellicall to use the system because the
system was built by AT&amp;T and contains valuable competitive information.

AT&amp;T alleges that when callers use an AT&amp;T Card or Bell company calling card at
an Intellicall pay phone, the pay phone automatically places a separate call
through AT&amp;T or local Bell facilities to a pre-programmed telephone number so
that AT&amp;T&#039;s validation system will automatically check the card number.

If the card number is valid, the Intellicall pay phone then puts through the
original customer call.

&quot;As a result of these practices,&quot; the lawsuit says, &quot;Intellicall
surreptitiously and without authorization obtains validation data from AT&amp;T,
obtains fraud control for calls by its customers without having to invest in
fraud control facilities or otherwise purchase fraud control services, imposes
costs on AT&amp;T, and... obtains an unfair advantage over its competitors
providing pay telephone and/or long-distance service, including AT&amp;T.&quot;

Although AT&amp;T does not authorize other companies to accept the AT&amp;T Card and
does not permit competitors to use its validation system, the lawsuit notes
that Intellicall could purchase validation services for Bell company calling
cards from other companies.

AT&amp;T said it notified Intellicall that it was violating AT&amp;T&#039;s proprietary
rights and gave Intellicall every reasonable opportunity to halt the fraudulent
validation practice.  Only after Intellicall persisted in its unfair practices
did AT&amp;T decide to take legal action.

AT&amp;T v. Intellicall:  The Lawsuit Is Over                     November 13, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Dallas -- AT&amp;T and Intellicall, Inc. today announced the settlement of a
lawsuit filed by AT&amp;T against Intellicall, seeking damages and an injunction.
AT&amp;T had accused Intellicall of unauthorized access to AT&amp;T&#039;s calling card
validation system.

The settlement also covered potential counterclaims which Intellicall intended
to file against AT&amp;T.

In the agreement, Intellicall acknowledged AT&amp;T&#039;s proprietary rights in the
Billing Validation Application system, and agreed to make modifications in its
licensed pay telephone software to safeguard against unauthorized access and
use of the AT&amp;T system.

The terms of the agreement include an undisclosed payment by Intellicall to
AT&amp;T to contribute to the establishment of a compliance program which will
permit AT&amp;T to monitor unauthorized access to its billing systems.

&quot;AT&amp;T is pleased that a settlement recognizing AT&amp;T&#039;s proprietary right to the
validation system was reached so quickly,&quot; said Gerald Hines, director of AT&amp;T
Card Services.

U.S. Inquiry Into Theft From Apple                            November 19, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by John Markoff (New York Times)

A former Apple Computer Inc. engineer has said he was served with a grand jury
subpeona and told by an FBI agent that he is a suspect in a theft of software
used by the company to design its Macintosh computer.

In June a group identifying itself as the Nu Prometheus League mailed copies of
computer disks containing the software to several trade magazines and software
developers.

Grady Ward, age 38, who worked for Apple until January (1989), said that he
received the subpeona from an FBI agent, who identified himself as Steven E.
Cook.

Ward said the agent told him that he was one of five suspects drawn from a
computerized list of people who had access to the material.  The agent said the
five were considered the most likely to have taken the software.

A spokesman for the FBI in San Francisco said the agency would not comment on a
continuing investigation.

Ward said he had told the FBI he was innocent but would cooperate with the
investigation.

The theft of Apple&#039;s software has drawn a great deal of attention in Silicon
Valley, where technology and trade-secret cases have highlighted the crucial
role of skilled technical workers and the degree to which corporations depend
on their talents.

The case is unusual because the theft was apparently undertaken for
philosophical reasons and not for personal profit.

There is no indication of how many copies of the program were sent by Nu
Prometheus.

Software experts have said the programs would be useful to a company trying to
copy the distinctive appearance of the Macintosh display, but it would not
solve legal problems inherent in attempting to sell such a computer.  Apple has
successfully prevented many imitators from selling copies of its Apple II and
Macintosh computers.

The disks were accompanied by a letter that said in part:  &quot;Our objective at
Apple is to distribute everything that prevents other manufacturers from
creating legal copies of the Macintosh.  As an organization, the Nu Prometheus
League has no ambition beyond seeing the genius of a few Apple employees
benefit the entire world.&quot;

The group said it had taken its name from the Greek god who stole fire from the
gods and gave it to man.

The letter said the action was partially in response to Apple&#039;s pending suit
against Microsoft Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co., accusing them of copying the
&quot;look and feel&quot; -- the screen appearance -- of the Macintosh.

Many technology experts in Silicon Valley believe Apple does not have special
rights to its Macintosh technology because most of the features of the computer
are copied from research originally done at Xerox Corp.&#039;s Palo Alto Research
Center during the 1970s.  The Macintosh was not introduced until 1984.

The theft came to light in June after Macweek, a trade magazine, published the
letter from Nu Prometheus.

At the time the theft was reported, executives at Apple, based in Cupertino,
California, said they took the incident seriously.

A spokeswoman said that Apple would not comment on details of the
investigation.

Ward said he had been told by the FBI agent that the agency believed Toshiba
Corp. had obtained a copy of the software and that copies of the program had
reached the Soviet Union.

The software is not restricted from export to the Communist bloc.  Its main
value is commercial as an aid in copying Apple&#039;s technology.

Ward said the FBI agent would not tell him how it believed Toshiba had obtained
a copy of the software.

Ward also said the FBI agent told him that a computer programmer had taken a
copy of the software to the Soviet Union.

Ward said the FBI agent told him he was considered a suspect because he was a
&quot;computer hacker,&quot; had gone to a liberal college and had studied briefly at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#039;s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.

The term &quot;hacker&quot; was first used at MIT to describe young programmers and
hardware designers who mastered the first interactive computers in the 1960s.

Ward is the second person to be interviewed by the FBI in the investigation of
the theft.

Earlier Charles Farnham, a businessman in San Jose, California, said two FBI
agents came to his office, but identified themselves as reporters for United
Press International.

Farnham, a Macintosh enthusiast, has disclosed information about unannounced
Apple products, said that after asking him to come outside his office, the men
said they were FBI agents and proceeded to question him about Nu Prometheus
group.  He said he was not told that he was a suspect in the case.

UPI has complained to the FBI because of the incident.

Ward said he had joined Apple in 1979 and left last January to start his own
company, Illumind.  He sells computerized dictionaries used as spelling
checkers and pronunciation guides.

He said the FBI told him that one person who had been mailed a copy of the
Apple software was Mitchell Kapor, founder of Lotus Development Corporation.

Kapor returned his copy of the disk unopened, Ward said the agent told him.

Ward said the FBI had also said he was suspect because he had founded a group
for the gifted known as Cincinnatus, which the agent said had roots in Greek
mythology that were similar to the Nu Prometheus group.

Ward said the FBI was mistaken, and Cincinnatus is a reference from ancient
Roman history, not Greek mythology.

Data-Destroying Disc Sent To European Computer Users          December 13, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by John Markoff (New York Times)

A computer disk containing a destructive program known as a Trojan horse has
been mailed to computer users in at least four European countries.

It was not clear if any copies of the program had been mailed to people in the
United States.

The program, which threatens to destroy data unless a user pays a license fee
to a fictitious company in Panama City, Panama, may be a widespread attempt to
vandalize thousands of personal computers, several computer experts who have
studied the program said Tuesday, December 12.

Some computer experts said the disk was mailed by a &quot;PC Cyborg&quot; company to
subscribers of personal computer trade magazines, apparently using mailing
lists.

The disk is professionally packaged and accompanied by a brochure that
describes it as an &quot;Aids Information Disk,&quot; the computer experts said.  But
when it is installed in the user&#039;s computer it changes several files and hides
secret programs that later destroy data on the computer disk.

Paul Holbrook, a spokesman for the Computer Emergency Response Team, a U.S.
government-financed security organization in Pittsburgh, said his group had
confirmed the existence of the program, but did not know how widely it had
spread.

Trojan horses are programs hidden in software that secretly insert themselves
in a computer when the software masking them is activated.  They are different
from other secret programs like viruses and worms because they are not
infectious:  They do not automatically copy themselves.

A licensing agreement that accompanies the disk contains threatening
information.

It reads in part:  &quot;In case of your breach of this license, PC Cyborg reserves
the right to take any legal action necessary to recover any outstanding debts
payable to the PC Cyborg Corporation and to use program mechanisms to ensure
termination of your use of these programs.  The mechanisms will adversely
affect other programs on your microcomputer.&quot;

When it destroys data, the program places a message on the screen that asks
users to send $387 to a Panama City address.

John McAfee, a computer security consultant in Santa Clara, California, said
the program had been mailed to people in England, West Germany, France and
Italy.

The Executive Computer:  From Espionage To Using A Printer     October 27, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Peter H. Lewis (New York Times)

Those executives who pay attention to computers are more likely to worry about
grand issues like productivity and small ones like how to make their personal
printers handle envelopes than whether the KGB has penetrated their companies.
In a fresh crop of books, they will find lessons on all these matters.

Perhaps the most entertaining of the new books is &quot;The Cuckoo&#039;s Egg&quot; ($19.95,
Doubleday), by Dr. Clifford Stoll, an astronomer.

Because he was the rookie in the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories in California,
he was asked to track down and fix a glitch in the lab&#039;s accounting software,
which had found a 75-cent discrepancy when it tried to balance the books.

&quot;First-degree robbery, huh?&quot; was Stoll&#039;s first reaction.  But by the time he
was done nearly a year later, he had uncovered a West German spy ring that had
cracked the security of American military and research computer networks,
gathering information that it sold to Moscow.

Beyond the entertainment value of this cat-and-mouse hunt, the book has lessons
for any corporate computer user.  The message is clear:  Most companies are
irresponsible about security.

The ease with which the &quot;hacker&quot; penetrated even military installations was
astonishing, but not as astonishing as the lack of concern by many of the
victims.

&quot;The Cuckoo&#039;s Egg&quot; follows the hunt for the unknown intruder, who steals
without taking and threatens lives without touching, using only a computer
keyboard and the telephone system.

The detective is an eccentric who sleeps under his desk, prefers bicycles to
cars, and suddenly finds himself working with the Federal Bureau of
Investigation, the Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security
Agency.

Although the criminal and the hunter deal in the esoteric realm of computer
code and data encryption, Stoll makes the technology accessible.

He also discovers that navigating the global electronic grid is less difficult
than navigating the bureaucracies of various government agencies.

And while he was a whiz at tracing the cuckoo&#039;s electronic tracks from Berkeley
to Okinawa to Hannover, West Germany, Stoll reveals himself to be helplessly
lost on streets and highways and befuddled by such appliances as a microwave
oven.

Besides the more than 30 academic, military and private government
installations that were easy prey for the spies, the victims included Unisys,
TRW, SRI International, the Mitre Corporation and Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman Inc. --
some of the very companies that design, build and test computer systems for the
government.

&quot;No doubt about it, the shoemaker&#039;s kids are running around barefoot,&quot; Stoll
writes.

One leading character in the book is Dr. Bob Morris, chief scientist for the
National Security Agency and the inventor of the security for the Unix
operating system.

An epilogue to the book, dealing with an unrelated computer crime, recounts the
discovery that it was Morris&#039;s son who wrote the rogue program that shut down a
national network for several days last year.

In &quot;The Macintosh Way&quot; ($19.95, Scott, Foresman &amp; Co.), Guy Kawasaki, a former
Apple Computer Inc. executive who is now president of a software company, has
written a candid guide about management at high-technology companies.

Although his book is intended for those who make and market computer goods, it
could prove helpful to anyone who manages a business.

Dialing Away U.S. Area Codes                                  November 13, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by Laure O&#039;Brien (Telephony Magazine)

The current endangered species in the news may not be an animal at all.  The
number of available area codes in the United States is dwindling rapidly.
Chicago consumed a new code on November 11, 1989 and and New Jersey will gobble
up another one on January 1, 1990.

There are only nine codes left, and they are expected to be used up by 1995,
said Robert McAlesse, North American Numbering Plan administrator and member of
Bellcore&#039;s technical staff.

&quot;In 1947 (Bellcore) started with 86 codes, and they projected exhaustion in 100
to 150 years.  They were off by a few years,&quot; McAlesse said.

When the 152 available codes are exhausted, Bellcore will use a new plan for
creating area codes.

A total of 138 codes already are assigned.  Five of the remaining 14 codes are
reserved for service access codes, and 9 are for geographic area codes.

Under the current plan, a 0 or a 1 is used as the second digit while the first
and last digits can range between 2 and 9.  Under the new plan the first digit
will be between 2 and 9 and the following two digits will be numbers between 0
and 9, McAlesse said.

The new plan will create 640 potential area codes, he said.  Bellcore isn&#039;t
predicting when the newly created codes will run out.

&quot;The growth in new services and increase in the number of telephones are
exhausting the codes.  The biggest increases are cellular telephones, pagers,
facsimile machines and new services that can have more than one number,&quot;
McAlesse said.

The current unassigned codes include 210, 310, 410, 706, 810, 905, 909, 910 and
917.  The Chicago area took the 708 code, and New Jersey will take 908.

In the Chicago metropolitan area, the suburbs were switched from the 312 area
code to the new 708 code.  Residents and businesses within the city limits
retained the 312 code.

Illinois Bell started preparing for the change two years ago with the
announcements alerting business customers to change stationary and business
cards, said Gloria Pope, an Illinois Bell spokeswoman.  Now the telco is
targeting the residential market with billboard reminders and billing inserts.

The cost of technically preparing for the new code, including labor, is
expected to reach $15 million.  But Pope said that does not include mailings,
public relations efforts and business packages designed to smooth out the
transition.  The telco will absorb the cost with budgeted funds, and no rate
increase is expected, she said.

Modifying the network to recognize the new code started about six months ago
with translation work.  Every central office in the Chicago Metropolitan area
was adapted with a new foreign-area translator to accept the new code and route
the calls correctly, said Audrey Brooks, area manager-Chicago translations.

The long distance carriers were ready for the code&#039;s debut.  AT&amp;T, US Sprint
and MCI changed their computer systems to recognize the new code before the
Chicago deadline.

&quot;We are anticipating a pretty smooth transfer,&quot; said Karen Rayl, U.S. Sprint
spokeswoman.

Businesses will need to adjust their PBX software, according to AT&amp;T technical
specialist Craig Hoopman.  &quot;This could affect virtually every nationwide PBX,&quot;
he said.  Modern PBX&#039;s will take about 15 minutes to adjust while older
switches could take four hours.  In many cases, customers can make the changes
themselves, he said.

A New Coating Thwarts Chip Pirates                             November 7, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
by John Markoff (New York Times)

Several years ago, clever high-technology pirates removed a chip from a
satellite-television descrambling device made by General Instrument
Corporation, electronically siphoned out hidden decryption software and studied
it to figure out a way to receive clear TV signals.

When the company later tried to protect the chips by coating them with epoxy,
the pirates simply developed a solvent to remove the protective seal, and stole
the software again.

Now government researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, a weapons
and energy research center in Livermore, California, have developed a special
coating that protects the chip from attempts to pry out either the chip design
or the information it contains.  In the semiconductor industry, a competitor&#039;s
chip design can be copied through a process called reverse engineering, which
might include determining the design through an electron microscope or by
dissolving successive layers of the chip with a solvent.

Already a number of government military and intelligence agencies are using the
coating to protect circuits containing secure information.  The government has
qualified 13 U.S. chip makers to apply the coating to chips used by certain
government agencies.

The Lawrence Livermore research, known as the Connoisseur Project, has
developed a resin about the consistency of peanut butter that is injected into
the cavity surrounding the chip after it has been manufactured.  The coating is
heated and cured; The chip is then sealed with a protective lid.

The special protective resin is opaque and resists solvents, heat, grinding and
other techniques that have been developed for reverse engineering.

A second-generation coating is being developed that will automatically destroy
the chip when an attempt is made chemically to break through the protective
layer.

Another project at the laboratory is exploring even more advanced protection
methods that will insert ultra-thin screens between the layers of a chip,
making it harder to be penetrated.

U.S. Firm Gets Hungarian Telephone Contract                    December 5, 1989
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Taken from the St. Louis Post-Dispatch (via New York Times News Service)

U.S. West Inc., one of the seven regional Bell telephone companies, announced
that it had signed an agreement with Hungary to build a mobile cellular
telephone system in Budapest.

The Hungarian cellular system will be the first such telephone network in
Eastern Europe.

Because of the shortage of telephones in their country, Hungarians are expected
to use cellular telephones for basic home service, as well as mobile
communications.

For Hungary and the other Eastern European countries that have antiquated
telephone systems, it will be faster and cheaper for the Government to deliver
telephone service by cellular networks than it would be to rebuild the nation&#039;s
entire telephone apparatus.

A cellular telephone network transmits calls on radio waves to small receiving
antennas, called &quot;cell&quot; sites, that relay calls to local phone systems.  The
system to be built in Hungary will transmit calls from cellular phone to
cellular phone and through the existing land-based telephone network.

The system, which is scheduled to begin operation in the first quarter of 1991,
will initially provide cellular communications to Budapest&#039;s 2.1 million
residents.  Eventually, the system will serve all of Hungary, a nation of 10.6
million.

Hungary has 6.8 telephone lines for every 100 people, according to The World&#039;s
Telephones, a statistical compilation produced by AT&amp;T.  By comparison, the US
has 48.1 lines for every 100 people.

1.  Phone Fun (November/December) -- Some students at Columbia University in
    New York City have added a twist to that ancient annoyance, the chain
    letter.  The students have taken advantage of the school&#039;s newly installed,
    $15 million IBM/Rolm phone system&#039;s ability not only to store messages like
    an answering machine, but also to take and receive messages and send them
    -- with comments -- to a third party.

    Last spring, brothers Anil and Ajay Dubey, both seniors, recorded a parody
    of rapper Tone Loc&#039;s Top 10 single &quot;Funky Cold Medina&quot; and sent it to some
    buddies.  Their friends then passed the recording along with comments, to
    some other pals, who passed it on to other friends...  and so on, and so
    on, and so on.  Eventually, the message ran more than ten minutes and
    proved so popular that the phone mail system became overloaded and was
    forced to shut down.

    Catalyst, Emmanuel Goldstein, Knight Lightning, Michael Synergy (of Reality
    Hackers Magazine), Phiber Optik, Piper, Sir Francis Drake, Taran King, and
    many old TAP subscribers.

    The Well is accessible through CompuServe&#039;s data network.  All charges for
    using The Well by hackers were absorbed by Harpers.

    There were many people on The Well posing as hackers to try and add to the
    discussion, but it turns out that some of them like Adel Aide, were shoe
    salesmen.  There were also a few security types, including Clifford Stoll
    (author of The Cuckoo&#039;s Egg), and a reporter or two like Katie Hafner (who
    writes a lot for Business Week).

    The contents of the discussion and all related materials will be used in an
    article in an upcoming issue of Harpers Magazine.

4.  Phrozen Ghost has supposedly been arrested for crimes relating to hacking,
    telecommunications fraud, and drugs.  No other details are known at this
    time.  Information sent to PWN by Captain Crook.

5.  SurveillanceCon &#039;89 -- Tuc, Susan Thunder, and Prime Suspect all attended a
    Security/Surveillance Convention in Washington DC recently at which both
    Tuc and Susan Thunder gave presentations about computer security.  Tuc&#039;s
    presentation dealt largely with bulletin boards like Ripco in Chicago and
    newsletters like Phrack Inc.  Audio cassettes from all the speakers at this
    convention are available for $9.00 each, however we at PWN have no
    information about who to contact to purchase these recordings.

                    <p>The <a href="/google-hacking-database">Google Hacking Database (GHDB)</a>
                        is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
                        and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
                        this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
                        information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
                        subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
                    </p>

                    <p>The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
                        Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
                        Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
                        member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
                        by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
                        recorded at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html"
                                       target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEFCON 13</a>. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
                        to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
                        the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
                        unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
                        Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
                        information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
                        show examples of vulnerable web sites.
                    </p>

                    <p>After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
                        over to <a
                                href="https://www.offensive-security.com/community-projects/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offensive Security</a> in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
                        an extension of the <a href="/">Exploit Database</a>. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
                        other online search engines such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing</a>,
                        and other online repositories like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>,
                        producing different, yet equally valuable results.
