         Welcome to Phrack Pro-Phile I.  I started thinking about it and
personally had always been interested in people&#039;s backgrounds, especially those
who are around a lot, have been around for a long time, or are sysops.  This
new feature of Phrack Inc. will present info about various members of the
phreak/hack community ranging from personal to public.  This month&#039;s
interviewee....

                                 Crimson Death
                                 ~~~~~~~ ~~~~~

         Crimson Death is the sysop of Hell Phrozen Over, a private phreak/hack
bulletin board in Philadelphia, PA. (215).
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Personal
~~~~~~~~
             Handle: Crimson Death
           Call him: Robb
       Past handles: The Sorcerer (before he was a phreak, a pirate handle)
      Handle origin: AD&amp;D Monster Manual II
      Date of Birth: February 17,
Age at current date: 16 years old
             Height: 5&#039;3&quot;
             Weight: 110 lbs
          Eye color: Brown outlined with green
         Hair Color: Dark brown
           Computer: Apple //e with 10 meg hard drive
  Sysop/Co-Sysop of: Hell Phrozen Over, Missing Link, Skull Kingdom
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
         Crimson Death started out in the BBS world in 1984 with a public
board, Spirit World, which was run on an Apple //e, 2 floppies, GBBS, and 300
baud.  He had originally gotten his Apple computer in January of 1984.  Then,
on one memorable day, The Videosmith logged onto his board and they became
friends.  In February of 1985, he started phreaking.  When his 10 meg Sider
came, he started Hell Phrozen Over as a private bulletin board system.  Death
called a few memorable boards, including the Army BBS, Shadowland, The Missing
Link, The Labyrinth, as well as his own.  His phreak teacher was The
Videosmith.

         Robb goes to a public school and has skipped a grade, so he is
currently one grade ahead of his time.  His phreaking is unknown at school
except to a few.  He considers himself pretty well versed in programming, and
from the way his board runs, I would agree.  CD&#039;s girlfriend is The Silver Fox,
(note the word &quot;Fox&quot;) that he met on Datanet, and popular opinion says she is
REALLY decent looking.

         Crimson Death does no hacking right now, but in the future when he
gets a bit of free time, he plans on learning about it.  Mentioned earlier was
his involvement in Phreak Klass 2600.  Red Devil has taken it down, and they
are looking for a replacement board, Phreak Klass II.  Death has met various
phreaks, old and new, and those of who really stuck out in his mind were: The
Videosmith, Mark Tabas, TUC, Telenet Bob, The Sprinter, and Dr. Who.  He listed
others too, but he felt that these were the &quot;mentionables&quot;.  Just thought I&#039;d
let a few out there know.  Hell Phrozen Over is co-sysoped by Silicon Swindler,
and the Phreak Adviser is The Videosmith, a 300/1200 baud, 10 meg system.  He
was, in the past, in PhD, which stands for Phreak/Hack Destroyers.  This
eventually evolved into Camorra.  PhD was run by The Executioner (301), members
included Red Devil, Silver Sabre, and Scorpion among others.

         He is quite a comedian also, he wishes for all of you to have his last
name, address, and credit card number (heh heh).  The following are excerpts
from his Death Plan File, Inc. project.  I hope you find this phile
interesting.

People Crimson Death would like to say a few things to
------------------------------------------------------

Krista (the person I hold dearest to my heart, who I love and cherish even
        more-so than I do myself; and for being herself)

Silicon Swindler (For being my best friend for the past few years. I would
                  like to thank him for sticking with me through A LOT
                  of bad times)

The Videosmith (for introducing me the mystic world of phreaking, being my
                mentor in this &quot;mystic world&quot;, but most of all being a
                friend)

The Executioner (who can be an egotistical asshole at times, but showed
                 me he really does care at Phreak Con, when a 6&#039; 8&quot;
                 ogre wanted my ass)

Red Devil (who has put up with all of my cut-ups and not kicked the
           shit out of me, even though he could. Sorry about that)

The People at Data-Tek (who put up Datanet in which without it, I would
                        have never met Krista)

Everyone Else who I didn&#039;t mention (for the one&#039;s who I know care; and
                                    the people who put up with my faults)

*TOTAL LOSERS*: The Sting (Otto) (414), Black Majik, Bloody Sabath.

The above three people have busted on me for having had an illness. In May, of
1983 I was struck with Leukemia, cancer of the blood. Luckily, I was cured
of this disease, and now lead a normal life. Yes, I was bald at one period of
time, but I am not now. Even so, that is nothing to bust on. I don&#039;t care
who it is, and what they have done to you, because busting on an illness is
is pure idiocy. No one understands...until they or someone they love is
struck.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I hope you enjoyed this phile, look forward to more Phrack Pro-Philes coming in
the near future.  Oh, and one last thing, I&#039;m taking a poll from all
interviewees.

Of the general population of phreaks you have met, would you consider most
phreaks, if any, to be computer geeks?  Crimson Death says &quot;No&quot;.  Thanks for
your time Robb.

                             False Identification

                                      By

   The objective of this file is to teach one to change his or her current
drivers license to make one 21, without taking apart the drivers license
itself. This will be taught to you in a quick, inexpensive, easy to understand
process. The materials used are laminated sheets (easily obtainable from a
school supply store for around a dollar to two dollars for a number of sheets),
pair of good scissors, and a copy machine.

   The first step in the process calls for the copy machine (a copy machine at
the supermarket works good). Make two copies of your drivers license. Take one
copy and search for a digit on one of the copies that will change the current
year on your license to one that will change your age (21). Once you have found
the digit on one copy cut it out so just the digit is there (a square segment
with a little trim around the edges is a good cut). Then take the other copy
and cut out the current last digit of the year you were born in basically the
same shape as the last. Put the cut out digit under the copy that you had cut
out your current digit of the year you were born. Now having a little trim
around the cut out digit from the first copy will assist you when lining it up
under the second copy when you put it in the copy machine. Now that you have
the new digit from the first copy sitting underneath but showing on the second
copy place it in the copy machine and make a copy so that you will have an
original of the new base part of the license.

   Now since most copy machines are black and white you will have to cut away
the states license on the top of the license (e.g. Illinois License). Now place
the new base of the license with the cut away license name over the old base of
the current license. The new base might not match up like it should but line it
up as a good as possible. Now place a piece of the laminated sheet cut out to
configure the license on top of the new base. Cut away any overlaps of
laminated paper and iron over the license with Mom&#039;s good old iron.

   Notes: This process has been proved to work. If you are the type of person
that looks very young then do not bother to make an ID. You will just get
caught and get into a lot of trouble. Also, be very careful at well known bars
and over 21 hang out spots. The employees at these places tend to flash a flash
light underneath the card to see if it is transparent. It is supposed to be.
With this process it is a little hard to see through the ID so be careful with
it if you do go to a place such as this. If you are pulled over by the police
then take a corner of the license and rip. It will not affect your original
license though it maybe a little sticky but, that should not be to big of a
problem. If any bubbling occurs just iron over it and l

                     Profile of MAX long distance service
                          Written by Phantom Phreaker
                    Presented by The Alliance  618-667-3825

 MAX is a long distance service that is part of Lexitel. Lexitel is soon going
to merge with Allnet. MAX is also going to be a Carrier when our area gets
Equal Access, along with GTE Sprint, SBS, US Telecom, ITT, AT&amp;T, and a few
others.
 The MAX dialup local to me is not in a CCIS area.
 First off, you will get the dull tone of the extender when you call.
 If you don&#039;t input any touch tones for 15 seconds (approx.) MAX will go to a
recording telling you &#039;We have received insufficient digits to process your
call. Please call customer service.&#039;. I believe that MAX dialups all use the
same recordings.
 Input a 6 digit code, followed by Area Code,Prefix and Suffix of the number
you&#039;re trying to reach, plus a four digit accounting code which can be any four
digits. If you have an invalid code, a clear ringing will be heard right after
you input the last digit of the Suffix, and will go to a recording &#039;You have
dialed an invalid authorization code. Please call customer service.&#039;
 If you have a good code you won&#039;t hear this ringing after the suffix and will
be allowed to enter the four digit accounting code. If you make an error in
typing in your code, you can hit either the # or * keys on your phone to return
to the initial tone. You can only abort back to the start while you are
entering digits, not after you hear the ring going to recording.
 2600 Hertz can be used to kick back the extender, thus after getting a bad
code, send 2600hz, and you&#039;ll be back at the initial tone, (similar to Sprint)
and can try more codes. After getting a code on a MAX service don&#039;t let the
call go through. If you don&#039;t hear the ringing going to recording then hang up
and save that code for later use.

 Some notes on MAX:
 -----------------
 If you wait at the initial tone more than 15 seconds, it will go directly to a
recording &#039;We have received insufficient digits to process your call. Please
call customer service.&#039;.
  MAX cannot be used to Blue box unless the dialup you have doesn&#039;t return to
the initial tone after sending 2600 Hertz.
 MAX cannot be used to reach certain exchanges such as 976 numbers, 800 INWATS
numbers, and Dial-it 900 numbers. Also certain exchanges belonging to the telco
cannot be reached through MAX.
 International dialing is not possible through MAX as far as I know at this
time.
 To identify a MAX dialup, enter 6 digit authorization code+700+555+XXX+XXXX.
 You will then get a recording &#039;Welcome to the MAX long distance Network.&#039;
 All recordings on MAX begin with &#039;All XX dot YY&#039;. In my area the first XX is
always 13. The second YY is a number assigned to the error you have made.
01=&#039;All XX dot 01. You have dialed an invalid authorization code. Please call
   Customer service.&#039;
02=Unknown at this time
03=&#039;All XX dot 03. We have received insufficient digits to process your call.
   Please try again or call Customer service.&#039;
04=&#039;All XX dot 04. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the
   number and dial again.&#039;
05=Unknown
06=Unknown
07=Unknown
08=Unknown
09=&#039;All XX dot 09. I&#039;m sorry, we are unable to complete your International
   call. Please try again or consult your local phone book for dialing
   instructions.&#039;
10=&#039;All XX dot 10. Welcome to the MAX long distance network. Thank you for
   using MAX.&#039;
 After dialing a number that cannot be reached through MAX you will hear a dull
tone for approx. one second then the ring to &#039;All XX dot 04&#039; recording.
 Note each recording will be played twice, then you will get a re-order.
 Autovon tones A,B,C and D entered at the initial tone will automatically go to
recording 03.
 No MF tones break the initial tone, except for 6.
 The information in this file cannot be guaranteed 100% accurate. MAX dialups
may operate differently in different areas.

         For those of you into the war-aspects of having phun, this is a little
phile to tell you about the breaching and clearing of obstacles.  The
techniques can be used by the anarchist to provide havoc in the city or by the
mercenary to help him out in any battle/battle games-type situation.

                                    ABATIS
                                    ~~~~~~
         An abatis is an obstacle created by cutting down trees so their tops
are criss-crossed and pointing toward the expected enemy direction.  It is most
effective for stopping vehicles in a forest (or along a tree-lined street).
The trees are left attached to the stumps as high as possible to make removal
more difficult.  This obstacle may be reinforced with mines and boobytraps.

                                      Ex:
                         _______|\_______ /||_______
                                ||\ /   //|| &lt;--fallen tree still attached
                                || ::  ::/ ||
                                || :::::::: ||
                                || /:::::: ||
                                  /    ^   \n                                       |
                     leaves and branches block the roadway

To clear an abatis:

1&gt;  Suppress the enemy covering the obstacle.
2&gt;  Secure whole area of all enemy elements.
3&gt;  Reduce the obstacle.  Mines and boobytraps must be found and can be
    disarmed by pulling their tripwires with grappling hooks and long ropes.
    Use pioneer tools or explosives to cut the trees from their stumps and then
    pull the logs out of the road with a strong car/truck.

                                   LOG CRIBS
                                   ~~~ ~~~~~
         A log crib is an obstacle constructed of logs, earth, and rocks.  The
logs are used to make triangular cribs which are filled with earth and rock.
These are used to block narrow roads and defiles.

                                      Ex:

To clear a log crib:

1&gt;  Suppress the enemy covering the obstacle
2&gt;  Secure whole area of enemy elements.
3&gt;  Reduce the obstacle.  Use direct fire weapons, explosives, pioneer tools
and vehicles to reduce the obstacle.

                           CRATERS AND TANK DITCHES
                           ~~~~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~~~~
         Craters and tank ditches are holes in the road or terrain that are put
there to stop the passing of vehicles, and are blown in there by explosives.
Sometimes, in tank ditches, barbed wire, mines and chemicals are placed in to
make the tank crews have a harder time.  These are cleared otherwise, though,
by bulldozing dirt into them by pushing in the sides of the holes.  Explosives
may also be used to blow down the sides.

                                     WIRE
                                     ~~~~
         Wire is used to separate infantry from armor and as roadblocks against
wheeled vehicles.

To clear wire obstacles:

1&gt;  Suppress the enemy covering the obstacle.
2&gt;  Secure whole area of enemy elements.
3&gt;  Clear a lane through the wire.  Use wire cutters, or explosives to remove
    the wire (or a bangalore torpedo if you have one [riiiight...]).  Watch for
    mines and boobytraps and mark them with engineer tape, cloth, or anything
    recognizable.
4&gt;  Destroy the marked mines with explosives or grappling hooks.
5&gt;  Mark cleared lane.

                      ...And for those really involved...
                                  MINEFIELDS
                                  ~~~~~~~~~~
         To maintain the momentum of an attack, the group must be prepared to
breach minefields.

1&gt;  Suppress the enemy covering the obstacle.
2&gt;  Secure whole area of enemy elements.
3&gt;  Clear a footpath/lane and mark the mines that are found.  The preferred way
    to clear a lane through a minefield is to use a rocket-propelled line
    charge or a bangalore torpedo (Army style).  However, the only way to clear
    a minefield without special equipment is to probe with pointed sticks.
    Bayonets should not be used because they can detonate AP mines and other
    type magnetic mines.  One squad probes while the platoon overwatches.
    The squad probing the footpath/lane through the minefield uses two probers:
    one in front, clearing a lane wide enough to crawl through; and a second
    one clearing 10 meters behind the first prober and slightly to one side so
    that their lanes overlap.  The probers should not carry their weapons,
    field packs, load-carrying equipment, helmets, etc.  Their equipment is
    carried by other squad members.  Two other men crawl along behind to secure
    the probers, to carry additional supplies, or to take a prober&#039;s job if one
    becomes a casualty (how pleasant...).  The probers should be rotated often
    to keep them from getting tired and careless.  The remaining squad members
    overwatch the probers.
    The probers mark mine locations with sticks, engineer tape, cloth, or
    toilet tissue.  They do not try to remove mines.
4&gt;  Secure the far side.  As soon as the squad has cleared a footpath/lane, it
    moves through the lane and secures the far side of the minefield.
5&gt;  Destroy the marked mines with explosives.
6&gt;  Mark cleared lane.
7&gt;  Move the group through the obstacle.

how you never play war-games.

                               Crashing DEC-10&#039;s
                                 by The Mentor
                                    3-13-86



        Occasionally there will be a time when destruction is necessary.
        Whether it is revenge against a tyrannical system operator or against
a particular company, sometimes it is desirable to strike at the heart of a
company...their computer.
        What follows is a fairly detailed explanation of how to go about
crashing a DEC-10 computer running any operating system.  The user will have
to be able to create and execute assembly level and high level language
files, as well as having a good working knowledge of programming.
        The first step is to obtain an account.  Whether this be a default
account like 5,30 (pw: GAMES) or an account that you hacked by some other
method, you have to be able to access the system.  Superuser access is not
necessary, however, for this method to work.
        At the heart of every mainframe computer is the central processing
unit.  The CPU handles all instructions, fetching them from memory, decoding
them, and executing them.  A DEC has what is called a DMA (Direct Memory
Access) Controller that functions as a small CPU handling all the input and
output from memory and peripherals, freeing the main CPU to execute instruc-
tions.  We take advantage of this fact in crashing the system.
        Theory:  The CPU depends on the DMA Controller to handle all memory
access.  If the DMA can be crashed, the CPU grinds to a halt and the sysop
has to run DSK:RAT to restore all the files on the system (a one hour process,
deadly at peak operating time.)  We cause the DMA to crash by slowing it down
incredibly and overflowing the system stack.
        Practice-
        There exists an area known as &#039;Job Data Area&#039; at octal 20 through 140
of the user&#039;s memory.  This stores all relevant information about the current
task executing.  The individual locations each have a 6-bit mnemonic starting
with .JB in each case.  These must be introduced into a symbol table as ext-
ernal references.
        The highest core address available to the user is stored at .JBREL
in the Job Data Area.  If you try to access more core than you are allowed,
you will get an interrupt and it will crash.  The first step is to disable
the interrupt.  This is done by setting bit 22 in the AC to 1.  This is done
with a mask as follows...
        APRENB  AC
        MOVEI   AC,20000 (octal)
        The interrupt is now shut out.  Next, you must start snatching up all
available system core.  This cannot be done by directly meddling with .JBREL.
Instead, you must alter AC (accumulator) to contain the highest desired
address and then move it into .JBREL.  This can be done with the following
subroutine.
        CORE    AC,
TOP:    MOVE    AC,.JBREL##
        AOJA    AC,.+1
        CORE    AC,
        BRA     TOP
        At first, incrementing only by one looks like a slow way to grab core,
but since it is only allocated in chunks of either 1K or 2K words, you can
quickly suck up a lot of memory.  (Following this file is a complete sample
program in MACRO-10 showing how to increase the core to a certain limit.)
        Now that we have all the core we can get, the system is already more
than likely slowing down.  This is good.  Now we put in the fatal blow.
You should already have prepared a program that relies heavily on recursion.
The choice languages for this are either C or Pascal.  Simply set up a simple
recursive program (Towers of Hanoi with 100 rings, for instance), and tell it
to execute.
        What will begin to happen is that the DMA stack will start filling up,
slowing the system down even further.  Eventually, after between 5 minutes and
15 minutes (longest it&#039;s ever taken me), you get the nice beep and...
        ;;OPSER- DEC SYSTEM-10 NOT RUNNING
        I&#039;ve only had to do this on three systems that the sysop really
pissed me off (not counting the system where I go to school, on which I do
it all the time when I&#039;m bored...)  It&#039;s kind of an extreme measure, but
it can be an effective one.
        The following program is a sample for those not familiar with MACRO-10
assembly language.

                            Centrex Renaissance
                             &quot;The Regulations&quot;
                       By Leslie Albin * (See Note)

                          From: On Communications
                       (October 1985, Vol. 2,No. 10)

                             By Jester Sluggo


     Regulatory  changes across the country have made new bargain
available to telecommunications users.  Centrex -- the homely old
central  office  service AT&amp;T planned to bury only  a  couple  of
years   ago   -- has  been  regroomed,   revitalized  and   often
rebaptized.
     As  Centrex,   Centron,  Caroline  or  Essx  -- the  various
regional trade names of Centrex service -- it is cheaper and more
powerful than ever in mosy parts of the country.
     The  bargain will only get better in regions where the  Bell
operating  companies (BOC) have seized on Centrex not only  as  a
logical  step in their progression toward an integrated  services
digital   network,   but   also  as  a  key  to   the   lucrative
telecommunications  aftermarket  -- as long as  those  regulatory
changes do not shift.
     The  Centrex service the regional BOC&#039;s were left with after
divestiture  was deliberately undernourished,  as part of  AT&amp;T&#039;s
migration  strategy to bolster sales of Western Electric  private
branch  exchanges.    Centrex  was  lacking  in  technology   and
marketing innovation, and users were abandoning it.
     But,  in  a little more than a year and a half,  the  RBOC&#039;s
(Regional  Bell  Operating  Companies) have managed to  win  over
state regulators to the idea of a thriving Centrex, gaining their
approval  of trunk equivalency rates,  innovative  tariffs,  rate
stabilization plans,  actual  detariffing and -- in one  case  --
complete deregulation.
     At the federal level, challenges to this revitalization have
been  rebuffed or have stalled before the FCC, and the RBOCs  are
pitching  for greater leeway in providing the  customer  premises
equipment to go with their Centrex service.
     &quot;The  regulators  have  been bending over backward  to  give
Centrex every competitive advantage,&quot; said Albert Angel, a lawyer
with the Washing D.C.  firm of Wood,  Lucksinger &amp; Epstein, which
represents  the  North  American  Telecommunications  Association
(NATA).
     &quot;Ultimately,   there  will  be  a  clear  finding  that  the
preferential treatment of Centrex is not justified,&quot; added Angel,
and  should  that happen,  Centrex customers -- even  those  with
price stability packages -- could find themselves committed to  a
service beset by escalating rates.
     Most  of  the  federal issues involving  Centrex  regulation
developed  as  a response to actions taken in  the  states.   For
instance,  NATA has sternly objected to &quot;trunk equivalency&quot; rates
authorized by a number of state commissions.
     The  concept  evolved when the FCC imposed  its  $6  monthly
customer  access  line  charge on new Centrex  lines  along  with
regular  business  lines.   Because Centrex uses lines much  less
efficiently than a PBX does, &quot;the net impact is very different on
a  Centrex subscriber than it is on a PBX subscriber,&quot; said  Greg
Laken,  division  manager of Centrex and central office  services
for  Bell Atlantic Corp.   Centrex requires one twisted pair  for
each station,  whereas a PBX requires one trunk for six or  seven
stations.
     Trying  to  keep  Centrex viable with  a  built-in  customer
access  line  charge burden six to seven times greater than  that
incurred by a comparable PBX would have been a tough proposition.
Bell  Atlantic&#039;s  BOCs,  like virtually every other  BOC  in  the
country,  won  permission  from  state regulators to  offset  the
higher  line charges for Centrex so that customers would  pay  at
the same level as owners of similarly sized PBXs.
     To  NATA,  this  amounts  to nothing more than  &quot;taxing  all
other  customers  for  the benefit of  Centrex  customers,&quot;  NATA
attorney Angel said.  But the FCC decided in summer 1985 that the
trunk  equivalency  rates  do not  undermine  its  access  charge
policy. and the lower rates for Centrex users remain in effect.
     Beyond whittling down customer access line charges, a number
of  BOCs  have  had  fresh  Centrex  tariffs  approved  by  state
commissions  that  chop the service&#039;s rates and offer  innovative
pricing schemes.   Bell Atlantic&#039;s BOCs,  for instance,  have won
approval for tariffs cutting Centrex rates 30% to 35%.   &quot;The net
effect,&quot;  said  Lakin,  &quot;is that it is a  very  price-competitive
entry.&quot;
     To  NATA,  the service&#039;s price competitiveness  arises  from
the  BOCs&#039;  continuing  monopoly position in  the  local  market,
although  BOC officials state firmly that Centrex is  not  priced
below  cost and,  in fact,  generates revenue to subsidize  other
services.
     According to Angel,  a Washington, D.C. residential customer
pays  a cost-justified rate of between $15 and $17 for the  local
loop and central office switching capability.  A Centrex customer
using  an  identical  local loop connected to  the  same  central
office pays only $12.  Many of the new tariffs being filed by the
BOCs   recognize   two   of  Centrex&#039;s   traditional   headaches:
instability and distance sensitivity.
     Now many of the new tariffs offer users price guarantees and
incentives   for  signing  the  long-term  contracts  that   give
telephone companies some stability in their Centrex base.
     By  locking in rates and either capping the associated costs
or  typing their increase to the Department of  Labor&#039;s  cost-of-
living index,  BOCs have been able to offer customers much of the
same predictability that a PBX does.  Most tariffs give customers
the  choice  of  three-,   five- or  seven-year  contracts,   the
incentives rising with the length of the agreement.
     Centrex  customers in the Chicago Loop area,  for  instance,
were paying a $12.52 per-line monthly charge if their system used
250  lines.   Under a tariff approved last fall,  however,  those
customers  saw the monthly charge drop to $10.94 and could  drive
it  down even further by signaling  long-term  contracts:  $10.09
per-line  under a three-year agreement,  $9.84 under a  five-year
agreement and $9.54 under a seven-year agreement.
     &quot;Slightly  less than half of our 400,000-line total base has
gone  on contract,&quot; said Lee Armagost,  Illinois Bell&#039;s  division
manager  for  tariffs and costs.   And the  concepts  success  is
continuing.&quot;
     For all of the BOCs&#039; success in winning lower Centrex rates,
some  companies  have  fared even better -- they  have  convinced
state  regulators to detariff Centrex service for  new  customers
and, in one case, to deregulate it entirely.
     Northwestern Bell seems to be the  current  detariffing  and
deregulating  champion among the BOCs,  having won  approval  for
detariffed  Centron  service  in all of its states  except  Iowa.
Iowa simply deregulated it.
     While detariffing allows the BOCs more freedom to  negotiate
with   large  Centron  customers,   deregulating  takes   Centron
assets,  expenses  and  revenues right out of the rate  base  and
removes the service from the regulators purview.
     According  to Tom Smith,  vice-president and chief executive
officer  of  Northwestern Bell Iowa,  the  company&#039;s  first  move
toward  deregulation  occurred in  1983,   when  the  Iowa  State
Legislature   passed   a  Bell-inspired  bill  that  called   for
competitive  services  to be  deregulated.   The  following year,
Northwestern   Bell   succeeded  in  getting  in   getting   more
legislation  passed  that declared Centron ready for  detariffing
because of its competitive nature.
     After  reviewing  the  legislature&#039;s  actions,   the   State
Commerce  Commission decided that if the lawmakers were convinced
Centrex was competitive and services were to be  deregulated,  it
would  skip over the detariffing of Centrex and simply deregulate
it, Smith said.
     What  followed  was  what  Smith  called  &quot;nine  months   of
intensive work,&quot; as regulators, company officials and consultants
from Anderson &amp; Co. sorted out the procedures for carving Centrex
away  from  the  rate base and set up safeguards  against  cross-
subsidies.
     &quot;A  central  office  is not something that has  this  little
compartment that says &#039;for service A&#039; and that little compartment
that says &#039;for service B&#039;&quot; Smith said of the accounting problem.
     NATA  agrees with that description and,  according  to  NATA
attorney Angel,  argues that because competitive Centrex services
must operate commingled with regulated facilities, the FCC should
halt  the detariffing and deregulating of the service or order it
to be sequestered in a separate subsidiary with other competitive
products.
     But the FCC has not acted on NATA&#039;s  complaint.   Meanwhile,
the  first customer has signed up for Iowa&#039;s deregulated  Centron
-- the state of Iowa itself.
     The  state  had solicited bids to replace its  Capitol  Hill
complex&#039;s  Centrex service in Des Moines when deregulated Centron
became available.   The new rates negotiated by Northwestern Bell
and the state&#039;s staff produced a savings of about $1 million  for
the state over the three-year life of the contract,  according to
Glen Anderson Jr., director of state communications for Iowa.
     While Anderson called the deregulated Centron service prices
&quot;a  dramatic savings,&quot; he also pointed out another incentive  for
signing up.
     &quot;The other factor was political,&quot; he said.  &quot;We did not have
an appropriation to proceed with the procurement of a switch.&quot;
     When  the Centron agreement runs out,  the state will be  in
the  market for a PBX again.   A member of Anderson&#039;s staff  said
the  staff remains convinced it can enhance its own program  with
its own switch.
     At  some BOCs,  the once feature-poor Centrex has caught  up
with  PBXs  in  many respects.   Where  telephone  companies  are
pushing  digital capabilities onto their networks, they are  also
pushing  digital capabilities onto Centrex.   Pacific  Bell,  for
instance,  can  offer fully digital Centrex service from many  of
its metropolitan central offices.
     A  number of BOCs concur with Bell Atlantic&#039;s position  that
digital  Centrex  is a natural rung on the ladder to an  ISDN  --
among  them  Pacific Bell and New York Telephone  Co.   Many  are
upgrading  Centrex service with PBX-like features short of  fully
digital service, including several versions call forwarding, call
waiting  and speed dialing.   Given the current strictures in the
FCC&#039;s  Second Computer Inquiry and the Modified Final  Judgement,
the expanded features list was bound to be called into question.
     NATA,  which has been leading the charge against the changes
in Centrex service,  is fighting its battle on four fronts at the
FCC:
     1)  Last  fall,   it  asked  the  FCC  either  to  halt  the
detariffing and deregulation of Centrex by the states or order  a
separation  of commingled facilities.   The FCC has not acted  on
the complaint.
     2)  Soon after filing that complaint,  NATA filed another --
this  one  questioning  the provision  of  competitive,  enhanced
features by a regulated,  basic telephone company.  The FCC acted
on  that complaint last summer,  deciding that features  such  as
speed  dialing,  call forwarding and customer station changes are
adjuncts  to  basic  service and can be offered  by  a  regulated
telephone  company  under  Computer  II.    Only  customer-dialed
account recording was found to be and enhanced service,  but  the
BOCs can request waivers to continue offering it.
     Until  the  waiver  requests are  considered,  the  FCC  has
granted  immediate,  temporary  waivers so the BOCs can  continue
providing customer-dialed account recording to existing customers
-- including the U.S.  Army.   Meanwhile,  the BOCs and NATA  are
seeking  reconsideration of  the FCC&#039;s decision in petitions  the
FCC  will address this month or next,  according to the FCC staff
member handling the issue.
     3)  Late last year,  NATA asked the FCC to to stop Ameritech
and Nynex Corp.  equipment subsidiaries from selling basic  phone
services,  including Centrex,  through their unregulated customer
premises equipment subsidiaries.
     When the FCC agreed to permit the joint marketing, it did so
with  the provision that non-Bell companies would also be  signed
up  as sales agents for the basic services.   As evidence of  the
problem,  NATA  pointed  to the sparse number of  non-Bell  sales
agents  being  signed up and the revenue moving from the BOCs  to
their sister customer premises equipment subsidiaries in the form
of sales commissions.   The FCC has not acted on the complaint or
NATA&#039;s  original petition seeking a reversal of the  sales  agent
decision.
     Bell Atlantic,  backed by the majority of RBOCs,  is seeking
FCC  permission  for  an  inverted version  of  the  sales  agent
decision  that  would let Bell Atlantic serve as sales agent  for
another  vendor&#039;s  customer premises  equipment  when  submitting
Centrex bids.
     4)   In  July  1985,   NATA  filed  an  even  more  sweeping
complaint,  a  Centrex  pricing action that argues that the  BOCs
are  using  their  monopoly power to  favor  Centrex  over  other
customers and to the detriment of PBX suppliers.
     The  complaint bridges a number of issues,  including  trunk
equivalency  rates,  pricing below cost and Computer II concerns.
The BOCs argued that Centrex is a state concern and, although the
FCC  has preempted state jurisdiction in other matters,  the  FCC
paused  to  consider the jurisdictional question -- a pause  that
could  last  six months or extend  &quot;indefinitely,&quot;  according  to
lawyers working on the matter.
     NATA  attorneys do not seem daunted by the chilly  reception
they&#039;ve  gotten at the FCC,  apparently expecting the temperature
to  rise  as  regulators worry less about the  viability  of  the
divested BOCs and begin to examine the economics of Centrex.
     &quot;All  rates  apart  from Centrex  are  rising  dramatically.
Centrex  rates are decreasing,&quot; NATA attorney Angel  said.   &quot;The
BOCs  would have you believe that Centrex provides a  subsidy  to
other services.   But,  in fact, documented studies show just the
opposite, that Centrex derives a subsidy.&quot;
     If  Centrex  is  priced  below cost,  why are  the  BOCs  so
delighted with it?   According to Angel,  the answer lies in  the
financial  structure of a regulated utility.   &quot;Centrex uses many
more  loops  than  necessary.   This leads  to  new  construction
budgets,  which lead to new investment,  which leads to a rate of
return  for the investors.&quot;  Investors,  Angel added,  &quot;make make
money by putting loop and plant all over the place.&quot;
     NATA&#039;s objections to the recent changes in Centrex rates and
services,   objections  that  do  not  extend  to  opposition  to
traditional  Centrex,  have generally been characterized  by  BOC
officials  and regulators as protectionist actions taken by a PBX
industry  that   did   not  really   want  the  full  competitive
environment for which it clamored.
     &quot;NATA  is frequently described as the whiner in the  corner,
as though it holds all the cards,&quot; Angel said.   The seven  RBOCs
are  far  better  financed,   he  added,  yet,  &quot;they  have  been
successful in painting themselves as the underdogs.&quot;

                              THE TRIED AND TRUE
                          HOME PRODUCTION METHOD FOR
                               &quot;METHAMPHETAMINE&quot;




Also known as:&quot;CRYSTAL&quot;,&quot;METH&quot;,&quot;CRANK&quot;,&quot;SPEED&quot; etc..........

Written and tested by: The Leftist.

Have you ever heard of speed? No, not those little pills that are shaped like
hearts, not black beauties, or magnum .357&#039;s, but real crystal.  This is the
exact drug that Hitler used on his troops in WWII to make them fight for days
on end.  This is the drug, that in the 60&#039;s, caused a &quot;smack&quot; uproar in New
York&#039;s &quot;Needle Park&quot;.  Now, you can make this very same drug, in your own
dangerous kitchen, safely and easily.  Once you do this a few times, you will
get the hang of it.  I no longer have to read the directions to produce it.

What to do with it once you have made it.
-----------------------------------------
Take a ball about the size of a lead pellet, and wrap it in tissue, and
swallow, or you can put it in capsules and use it.  You can smoke it, mix it
with vitamin B-12, and snort it like cocaine.  You can also sell it, for about
$65-70.00 a gram, and don&#039;t forget to cut it.  Remember, this is pure stuff!!

===============================================================================


List of chemicals and materials
-------------------------------

Dilute Hydrochloric acid--&gt;  This may be purchased at the hardware store.  It&#039;s
sold as a brick and driveway cleaner.  They call it muriatic acid.

Sodium Hydroxide--&gt; This, you probably already have. It&#039;s called &quot;lye&quot; at most
places; it&#039;s drain cleaner.

 Ethyl Ether--&gt; You&#039;ll probably have to make this.  Don&#039;t worry, it&#039;s a breeze.
Just go to your local K-mart or Auto parts store, and get a can of that
&quot;STARTING FLUID&quot; it comes in a spray can.  It&#039;s used for cold weather starting
of gasoline engines.

&quot;VICKS&quot; nasal inhalers--&gt;USE ONLY VICKS!! No other kind will work that I know
of.  These are at any drug store or grocery, etc..  You need 12 of em, but
don&#039;t buy em&#039; by the dozen, unless its winter time, then you can just say yer
from some nursing home, and you&#039;re stockin up for the patients.  Otherwise buy
em&#039; 2 at a time, if possible.  Get a friend to help you.  The druggists at the
drug store usually will know what&#039;s goin on if you buy quantity.

                            LIST OF EQUIPMENT
                            -----------------

 Two large eyedroppers- ten small glass bottles- one large glass or porcelain
bowl- coffee filters- one small jar with a top- one Pyrex baking dish- one
glass test tube.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                        -==*(&gt; N O T I C E &lt;)*==-

PLEASE! DON&#039;T SMOKE IN THE SAME ROOM WHEN YOU DO THIS.
OPEN A WINDOW IN THE ROOM IF POSSIBLE.
FOLLOW THESE INSTRUCTIONS EXACTLY.  THIS RECIPE HAS BEEN TESTED AND THIS IS THE
BEST WAY TO DO IT.  DON&#039;T TAKE SHORTCUTS, AND DON&#039;T EVEN START TO DO THIS
UNLESS YOU HAVE ABOUT 3 HOURS SPARE.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                            PREPARING ETHER!
(DO THIS FIRST)

Take one of the small bottles and spray starter fluid in it till it looks
half-full.  Then fill the rest of the way with water, cap the bottle and shake
for 5 minutes.  Then, draw off the top layer with the eyedropper, and throw
away the water layer.  Repeat this until you have about 3 oz. of ether.  Put
the cap on it, and put it in the refrigerator if you can.  (If you can&#039;t, don&#039;t
worry about it) You&#039;ll use this in the procedure below.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


                  THE TRIED AND TRUE HOME PRODUCTION METHOD

(1) Break open the inhalers, a pair of real sharp scissors does this good.
Place the cottons that were inside in a jar and close the lid.  (Remember you
use all 12 cottons.)

(2) In the bowl, combine 1- 1/3 oz. water and 2/3 oz. muriatic acid.  Shred
cottons in this solution, and knead for 5 minutes with hands.  (ALWAYS BE SURE
THERE&#039;S CLEAN RUBBER GLOVES on your hands.) You can do it bare-handed if you&#039;ve
got tough skin.  Squeeze all juice out of filters after you knead, and throw
em away.

(3) Filter the remaining liquid into the quart jar.  It will be necessary to do
this several times to get that awful smelling oil out.  The chemicals in the
inhalers have been bonded to the HCl, and the oils have been filtered off.
Throw the filters away.

(4) Pour enough of the solution into a small bottle to fill it 1/3 full.  Save
any leftover juice for the second batch.

(5) Pour 1/4 teaspoon of the lye crystals into the bottle and agitate.  Do this
carefully, as the mixture will become hot, and give off a gas.  Repeat this
step until the mixture remains cloudy.

(6) Fill the bottle from step (5) up the rest of the way with ether. Cap the
bottle, and agitate for about 8 minutes.  It is very important to expose every
molecule of the free-base to the ether for as long as possible.

(7) Let the mixture settle.  There will be a middle layer that is very thick.
Tap the side of the bottle to get this layer as thin as possible.

(8) Remove the top layer with the eyedropper, being careful not to get any of
the middle layer in it.  Save the top layer, and throw the rest away.

(9) Fill a bottle half-way with water, and about 10 drops of acid.  Pour the
top layer from step (8) into the bottle, and cap it.  Shake the bottle for 2
minutes.  When it settles, remove the top layer and throw it away.  The free
base has now been bonded to the HCl/water mixture.

(10) If there is anything left from step (3), repeat the procedure with it.

(11) Evaporate the solution in the Pyrex dish on low heat.  You can do this on
the stove, but I have found that if you leave it on top of a hot-water heater
(like the one that supplies hot water to your house) for about 2-3 days, the
remaining crystals will be Methamphetamine.

 Some notes:

Police are now calling this the &quot;New Cocaine&quot;.

It is very easy to become delirious off the ether fumes, so be sure you are
well ventilated, I mean it!!!

Small, aspirin, or experiment bottles seem to work the best for smaller
batches.  The measurements are not exact, so you don&#039;t have to be either.

In step 9, be sure you don&#039;t use too much water.  Remember, this is the water
you have to use to evaporate.

MCI Working With BOCs
---------------------
PacBell and MCI have combined forces to make the Security Pacific Data
Transmission Corporation.  Also it has been announced that field trials are
currently being held for Project Victoria: an integrated voice-data-video
service for homes and small businesses.

BOC stands for Bell Operating Company, and it refers to the small companies
that were formed after the breakup of AT&amp;T.

2600 Magazine Vs. Computel                         Wednesday, February 26, 1986
--------------------------
The following post was seen on Stronghold East Elite on the above date.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We&#039;re seriously thinking of taking some action against those nasty people at
Computel.  We published a letter this month which implied that the whole
operation was really a fairly sophisticated FBI scam.

We need to know as many facts as possible. Please contact us on Stronghold East
thru e-mail, in person, or call (516) 751-2600.  If we&#039;re not around, leave a
message saying when you&#039;ll call back and we&#039;ll try to be there.

Tell us if you&#039;ve had personal experience with Computel or if you know others
who have. If anyone has cancelled checks or the equivalent, let us know!

Also, if anyone can send us a Computel ad, which somehow everyone here at 2600
managed to miss, it would be helpful. Send that to:

                                     2600
                                   PO Box 99
                            Middle Island, NY 11953

Note: That&#039;s not our subscription address.  Subscriptions are at PO Box 752.

We may not be able to get these people prosecuted, but we can sure raise one
hell of a stink trying.

                                    2600/eg

Let it be said that hackers and phreaks will never stand aside
and be ripped off!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At this time we at Phrack have been able to uncover nothing more about the
Computel situation.

Mister Carding Busted
---------------------
Mister Carding first started in the profession of which his name comes forth in
the summer of 1984.  Since then he has accumulated roughly $45,000 worth of
merchandise.

He was caught once before in the summer of 1985 by Federal agents.  However, as
the investigation went on, they didn&#039;t have enough material and dropped the
charges.

Somewhere around the fourth week of February he was caught again, this time by
local authorities.  Here is how it all started:

&quot;Two months ago, I had tons of stuff coming in and had another guy picking it
up.  One night two weeks or so ago I had him go out to pick up a 20 meg 3 1/2
inch hard drive.  It was only the second time I had used that place as a drop
spot.  Unfortunately, he walked right into a police stakeout and he was
followed, first to my house and then to his own.&quot;

The next day the police went to the house of the friend and arrested him.  He
willingly signed an affidavit stating that Mr. Carding was the mastermind
behind the whole operation and that he was just an accomplice.

The court date has not yet been set but his crimes are as follows:

-  Fraudulent use of a credit card.
-  Possession of stolen merchandise in excessive amounts.
-  Computer Invasion (Hacking).

On March 6, 1986:

- The police confiscated his modem.  It had been carded.
- He had a meeting with the detectives, in which he had to take a lie detector
  test.  They asked him if he was lying about any part of the case, if he
  hacked into computers, and if he was using one specific person&#039;s card.
- He failed the test.

The police believe he hacked into the computer of a bank in New Jersey, Mr.
carding denies all of it.  However it is the truth.

Most people didn&#039;t know it but Mr. Carding was one of the better hackers around
and should be remembered.

He is pleading innocent to all charges and has signed a reverse affidavit
stating that the other guy was the mastermind.

He, as of this writing, has not been arrested but expects to have full charges
brought on him within the next week.

Boston Strangler Caught Scanning
--------------------------------
The Boston Strangler was caught scanning, he wasn&#039;t scanning an extender, he
was scanning a prefix in his home town. The phone company shut his line off and
now Boston Strangler may have to go to court, he claims he is under 1XB but
this is doubtful.

An employee of the phone company actually called him and told him to not use
the phone because his supervisor was checking for trouble on the line.
Apparently Boston Strangler scanned the entire prefix and once he was finished
the phone company called and said that he was in a lot of trouble.

AT&amp;T Suing The BOCs
-------------------
American Telephone and Telegraph is allegedly filing an 80 million dollar
lawsuit on the Bell Operating Companies.  They filed a complaint with the FCC
in January 1986 that claims that certain BOCs owe AT&amp;T 80 million dollars
because they failed to perform specific duties which were part of their billing
and collection contracts.

It is not known how much each company owes with the exception of Northwestern
Bell who owes $2 million.

Speed Demon Elite; Will It Return?
----------------------------------
The rumors are true, Radical Rocker did forget to pay his phone bill, and as a
result Speed Demon Elite was shut down.

Any talk about SDE being busted for having credit card information on the board
should be ignored as it is completely false and only one phreak&#039;s
interpretation of past events.

Radical Rocker has stated that everyone should expect Speed Demon Elite to
return in the near future.

Private Sector Damaged/Returning
--------------------------------
The Private Sector, which was supposed to have been returned by the 16th of
February, 1986 had been damaged in the hands of the authorities.  According to
them, &quot;one of the cards blew up.&quot;  They say that this happened before they had
the chance to erase the two &quot;illegal&quot; files they found on the hard drive.  So
now then they had to hold onto it a bit longer.  Naturally 2600 Magazine
suspected intentional foul play and stepped up the pressure on them to return
Private Sector. 2600 suspected the card they authorities were referring to was
the hard disk controller. They wouldn&#039;t stick another controller from another
machine in and they wouldn&#039;t let 2600 Magazine even look at the machine.  What
an outrage!
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On Friday, February 28, 2600 Magazine announced the following.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Private Sector has finally been returned, and is in the process of being
repaired.  It will be back up in the near future at the same number as before;
201-366-4431.  Call 2600 Magazine at 516-751-2600 for more details.

At the current writing of this article, Private Sector is up and running.  Only
time will tell if it will ever be the great bbs it once was.

TelePub&#039;86
----------
The 1986 TelePub meeting (originally planned up by Sigmund Fraud) was held on
the second floor of the Days Inn Hotel at 440 W.57th St. New York, NY.
Supposedly the first Telepub meeting since 1980, when one was held in
Washington DC.  The meeting room was called by some &quot;The Colosseum.&quot;

There was a $10 admission fee to the meeting room.  Supposedly Chesire
Catalyst&#039;s girlfriend (who some said was blind and had a seeing eye dog) was
collecting the money and handing out the name tags.

Some say there were about 25-30 people there in total, but Broadway Hacker
stated that there was only 23.  This included:

Broadway Hacker
Chesire Catalyst + girlfriend
Dr. PHATE (P&gt;hreaks H&gt;ackers A&gt;nd T&gt;elecom E&gt;nthusiasts)
Karl Marx
Lou Dolinar (reporter from Newsday Magazine in Long Island)
Ninja NYC
Private Sector + girl (Incidentally the programmer of the NEW Private Sector
                       BBS)
Sammy Junkins
Scan Man
Sigmund Fraud + friend
Slave Driver
The Bootleg
The Cracker
The Lineman
2600 Magazine - Tim and Paul

Most noted for not showing up were TUC and TWCB Inc.  Since this meeting was
generally supposed to be about the revival of TAP Magazine, it was VERY
surprising to some that TWCB didn&#039;t go. To others however, this was expected.

Their reason (excuse) has something to do with late plane arrivals and legal
problems (probably dealing with restrictions due to their probation. Supposedly
TUC&#039;s phone number was posted on the board at the front of the meeting room for
those who wanted to get in touch with him.

There was basically chit chat until around 11:15 am when Chesire Catalyst began
talking about CCIS (Common Channel Inter-Office Signaling).  His speech really
told nothing new but the best part of the discussion came out of the many
questions that were asked by the audience. Also around 11:15 is when Tim and
Paul from 2600 Magazine showed up.

A little later, Scan Man and The Bootleg started to discuss the possibilities
of satellite phreaking, and up &amp; down linking.

A little later, Private Sector appeared and with him came an ad from Personal
Computing Magazine.  The ad was from none other than Computel.  Computel, the
supposed and almost definite fed operation magazine was discussed for quite a
long time.

Chesire Catalyst began to distribute the final issue of TAP.  It was issue #91,
Spring 1984.  It included articles about credit agencies and UNIX, from BIOC;
Hacking Western Union, by TUC; Phreaks and hackers Morality, by Big Brother;
Passport check sums, and Bell Pie, among others.

2600 Magazine gave out their latest issue, February 1986, Volume 3 Number 2 as
well as other promotional items.

Sigmund Fraud was giving out older issues of TAP.

Among other things, BBS numbers were passed and there were all sorts of
telecommunication magazines lying around.

There was a break for lunch.  When they returned Scan Man started in on Chesire
about the money that MANY had sent in to TAP and never received the magazine or
their money back.  Chesire replied, &quot;It went to pay my bills.&quot;  He also made
other remarks about how he hasn&#039;t spent it all and how he may send it back but
he really didn&#039;t ever answer the questions that Scan Man put to him.

       Much of this information came from Slave Driver and Sigmund Fraud

TAP Revival
-----------
The TAP meetings in New York hadn&#039;t been going well, every week less people
would show and it was becoming pointless to attend.  Chesire Catalyst makes
roughly $1000 a month without printing TAP, and really he sees no reason to
restart.  Now TAP is being taken over by The W(hack)o Cracko Brothers, INC.

Chesire Catalyst has officially given the TAP name over to TWCB Inc. or has he?
These answers still remain a mystery.  TWCB plans to change the name of the mag
but not until after issue one is out.

Supposedly, Chesire had over 500 articles that never saw print that he has been
holding until the re-opening of TAP.  It is unknown if TWCB and the new TAP
Staff will acquire these articles.  Also it is unknown as too if some of those
articles were the ones in issue 91 of TAP that was recently distributed at
TelePub&#039;86 in New York City.

This new TAP has announced its editors as follows:

West Coast Editors: The Bootleg (Chief), The Cracker, and TUC
East Coast Editor: Susan Thunder &amp; Scan Man
Central Editors: Knight Lightning and Taran King

TWCB, has stated that on the day the first issue of TAP sees print, they will
quit phreaking, as they will undoubtedly be watched very closely from then on.

The status of Whackoland bbs is uncertain.  However TWCB has announced plans

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of the articles to expect in the first issue are interviews with The
Bootleg, Scan Man, Surfer Bill (concerning the Teltec Busts), files from
Bootlegger Magazine Issues (including those from issue #7 which has not yet
been released, this includes articles from MCI World Magazine, such as the MCI
World/MCI Security Interview), and NRK 01. TWCB claims to have received over a
100 articles from TOP Hack/Phreakers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As to the reasons concerning TWCB not appearing at the TAP-TelePub&#039;86, Tim
posted the following on the Phrack/TAP subboard on Metal Shop PRIVATE:

&quot;Well the meeting totally got screwed I couldn&#039;t make it, mainly because
 Cheshire sorta fucked TAP over. I think he was just in it for the money.  He
 was supposed to set up a PRIVATE meeting for TAP and it was going to be before
 the big meeting, well I called some people at the Days in at about 4:00 AM in
 the morning from the airport, the morning of the meeting, and they say well
 Cheshire says that the Private meeting is going to be after the Big Meeting
 and everyone already knows where were going.&quot;

&quot;Anyway I couldn&#039;t make it cause my plane landed at Laguardi and I was to take
 the plane back at 11:30 AM, well it takes 45 minutes to get to the Days Inn
 and didn&#039;t want to go to the big meeting because of serious LEGAL troubles.&quot;

(Editor&#039;s note:  The way I heard it directly from Tim, is that they called from
 St. Louis International to NYC and heard about the changes and knew about
 their late plane situation and decided to blow it off.)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The following is the story of how TWCB got started with TAP:

At first, there it was... Metal Shop standing proud, the home of Phrack
Newsletter.  TWCB saw this and put up Whackoland, which many of you may notice
was made specifically to look like MS.  Furthermore, TWCB was gonna have a
magazine originally called &quot;Whackoland Gazette&quot; until TWCB realized that with
Metal Shop and P-80 backing it and not just Whackoland, they would have to
change the name.  Phrack was supposed to be reprinted in this mag.  The list of
boards backing it grew quickly.  Still however it was a magazine without a
name.  Then TWCB started hearing about the revival of TAP and how the meetings
were not going very well.  They called Chesire Catalyst and started working out
the preliminary details, which brings us to where we are today.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are those however who would NOT like to see TAP restarted.  Among them,
2600 Magazine and Project Inform. Who could blame them?  No one likes
competition. This was okay however until, TWCB got a call from TUC, Lex Luthor,
Susan Thunder, and Mark Tabas (the staff members of Project Educate). They
claimed they want TWCB to publish for them, TWCB refused.  Later they received
a threatening call from TUC, in which they were informed that TUC would have
security people watching TWCB all the time and when they slipped up...*BOOM*

Now TWCB says that TUC later called and now is fully behind TAP and has
accepted editorship with TAP.

sections, was provided by TWCB Inc.  Especially the parts about Project Inform,

Phrack/Tap Status Report
------------------------
Regardless of the TAP situation, Phrack will remain in publication.  TWCB is
not very happy about this but, we really don&#039;t care.

The reasons that the Teltec Bust story did not appear in this issue of PWN is
that most of the info we have on it was supplied by Surfer Bill in an interview
he did with TWCB.  I have the taped interview, but as it was done by TWCB it
therefore was TAP property.  However, should TAP issue #1 not be in print by
the time Phrack V is ready, the Teltec story WILL appear in Phrack World News
Issue Number IV.

Monty Python Retires
--------------------
The following message appeared on Stronghold East Elite on Sunday, February 9,
1986, 4:50:53 PM.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  I have formally retired from the phreaking world, permanently.  I have *NOT*
been busted or been given any heat by anyone or any corporation.  I just have
no time what-so-ever to devote myself to give phreaking the appropriate time it
deserves. Schoolwork is bringing me down, and I have a big research paper
coming up, plus lots of other work.
  Honestly, phreaking doesn&#039;t seem much fun anymore. I especially hate the
attitudes of some phreaks (who shall remain nameless) who have their head in
the clouds, and put down everyone else.  It is quite a pain in the ass, and
these people look like fools, cause they are usually nothing quite like what
they think they are.
  My &quot;retirement&quot; entails the ceasing of myself of calling phreak boards,
hacking, and trashing. If you want to call me up on a conference, don&#039;t bother
(some of you have done so in the past).  I don&#039;t have the time and I am not
interested.

Later on and be seeing you from time to time...

                                 Monty Python
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor&#039;s Note:  Monty Python did ask for his account to be kept active at
                Stronghold East, so that he may see what&#039;s new, from time to
                time.  Also Monty Python has further stated that he may return
                to the phreak world this summer.

Demise of The Sprinter
----------------------
On the front page of the Wednesday, February 12, 1986 edition of the Seattle
P-I were the headlines COMPUTER INVASION CHARGED. Kirkland youth accused of
snooping. Some of the articles highlights were:

  One Michael P. Wilkerson (The Sprinter) was so successful in bypassing four
companies computer security.  He could copy or destroy data even the sysops
couldn&#039;t touch. The 18 year old most notably tapped into MicroSoft&#039;s
mainframe, along with 3 other companies, Kenworth Truck, Sunstrand Data
Control, and Resource Conservation companies.

  Looks like the district attorney is asking for a 90 day sentence and will get
it due to the cooperation (read plea bargaining) given by Sprinter. During the
search, the police discovered a list of TRW dial-ups and passwords and a
handwritten list of Visa, Mastercard, and Amex credit card numbers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It turns out that Sprinter is also under investigation for illegal credit card
purchases in his home state of California.  Most notably a $1400 bicycle.

A real nice point made by the district attorney is that possession of the list
of card numbers is NOT a crime.  Only the use of them is illegal.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now that was the Seattle P-I&#039;s interpretation of those events, this is
everything else we at Phrack Inc. have been able to uncover.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sprinter got busted for hacking on a large VAX/VMS system, and since it was
local to him, he didn&#039;t bother to go through an extender. He didn&#039;t feel there
was any danger considering he wasn&#039;t using a lead number.

Sprinter was well known for his &quot;bible&quot; of Sprint codes that was always kept
filled.  His bible and all computer equipment were confiscated.

Sprinter has 4 charges of hacking.  One nice part about this is that since his
bust, Sprinter has received several job offers for computer security, including
an offer from MicroSoft Inc.  (Editor&#039;s note:  I wonder if MicroSoft will drop
its charges against Sprinter as a part of the contract should he sign with
them).

The one interesting twist to this story is that Sprinter&#039;s bosses got into
some deep shit. While people were going through Sprinter&#039;s computer things
(which was in his bosses&#039; office) they found some evidence that led them to
believe that Sprinter&#039;s bosses were large cocaine dealers. Sprinter&#039;s bosses
haven&#039;t been heard from since.  Later reports did however tell that 1 of them
is now serving a 7 year prison sentence and the other is presumed dead.  This
part is very unspecific because it doesn&#039;t say what their basis for this
judgement are.  Did they find the body? Or is he just missing?

                 Much of this information has been provided by
                           Sally Ride (Space Cadet),
                              The Guardian Demon,
                                      and
                                 Jester Sluggo

Some Quick Notes
----------------
The Matrix, formally at 415-922-1370, is down due to the hard drive being
broken.  Dr. Strangelove says that as soon as he can get another hard drive,
the Matrix will return.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectre III, run by the Overlord of 815, is back up.  Overlord requests that
all former users of his system please call it back again.  The number is
815-874-8534.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Unconfirmed reports say that OSUNY, in New York, will soon be returning.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTE Sprint and U.S. Telecom have merged in order to become a stronger
competitor against MCI and AT&amp;T.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Compuserve is now linked with MCI Mail.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pit Fiend of NESSUS was busted for trying to obtain $3500 dollars in gold bars
by way of credit card fraud.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Missing Link BBS is back.  It is now a public board (or so it is believed).
The number is 806-799-0016.  Sysop: Egyptian Lover.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Because of problems dealing with Phoenix Phortress as well as a growing number
of rodents, Metal Shop PRIVATE has changed its general password.  It is no
longer &quot;REQUIRED&quot;.  Contact Taran King, Knight Lightning, or Cheap Shades for
the new general password, if you haven&#039;t been contacted yet (and you were/are a
member).  See story on Phoenix Phortress in this issues PWN.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The phreaks in Massachusetts and many other nearby areas are in quite a frenzy
right now due to a possible bust of Dr. Who 413.  It appears that while at
school, his parents were showed a search warrant by the Secret Service, who
then searched through his computer equipment as well as his notes etc.  He
eventually went home and is currently waiting for results.  There is a very
high probability that he has by now been busted.  Look for a future story on
his bust and its after-effects in the next Phrack World News.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phreak Klass 2600 originally died because Red Devil became bored of phreaking.
Now Crimson Death (Sysop of Hell Phrozen Over) and Videosmith are looking for
someone to run Phreak Klass 2600 II.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Feyd Rautha was NOT busted but did retire from the phreak world. In his own
words, he is &quot;phazed out&quot; or bored of phreaking.  A word to all, especially
sysops, there is another Feyd Rautha now.  He is in the 612 (Minneapolis) area.
Do not confuse him with the old elite mentioned here.

Extasyy Revisited
-----------------
This is a continuation of the article that appeared in Phrack World News Issue
Number One, about the breakup of Extasyy Elite.

The following are statements were told to Phrack by The Mentor:

1) I am NOT an FBI Agent.
2) The Poltergeist turned in all of Extasyy.  I have copies of the statements
   he made in Fort Worth to the FBI and to the Fort Worth Police Department to
   get me busted.  I do not know if he gave them Bit Blitz&#039;s information or
   not.
3) Yes, I made Bit Blitz return a computer.  Bit Blitz promised me a 212
   AppleCat in exchange for an Apple //e.  Then he failed to deliver the modem
   after I gave him the system.  This can be verified.
4) Crustaceo Mutoid is in the Racketeers, which Apple Rebel reassembled. Former
   Racketeers members who are now regrouped include: Hot Rod, Warezird, and The
   Micron.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The above information should be considered as direct quotes from The Mentor.
The Apple //e referred to is one of the many stolen Apple //es talked about in
the story below.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A little background on Extasyy.

Extasyy hung out on Hack Net BBS and FWSO, a bbs in Colorado. Poltergeist was
always bragging about how he was a master computer thief.

The Mentor wanted to try his luck as well. In his case, a not very wise idea.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
He and two others went to a high school computer room in Hayes County, Texas.
The room was separate from the rest of the building and one of the windows was
unlocked.

One of the other two people that went was a student at the school.

It took three car trips to transport all the computers, most of them were kept
in friend&#039;s apartments.  The Mentor gave many of the computers away to friends
of his, which helped his popularity greatly. He also gave two monitors to
Poltergeist.  However he neglected to scratch the serial numbers off them.  A
more or less fatal mistake.

Each of the apartment owners were allowed to keep one computer, as well as the
other two accomplices.  Gradually the people with the apartments began to hide
or give away some of the computers themselves.

The Mentor finally took all the rest of the computers to a storage warehouse
and then gave away or sold what was left of them.

One month later...

In Fort Worth, Texas, The Poltergeist was busted, mainly for credit card fraud,
but there were many other charges as well.  He talked all about Extasyy and its
members and when the police found the Mentor&#039;s phone number, Poltergeist talked
some more.  Among his confiscated equipment were two monitors.  The serial
numbers were checked and this led the police and FBI to the now one month old
computer theft in Hayes County.

Meanwhile, one of the apartment owners was trying to sell off one of his
computers to an ex-girl friend.  Unfortunately she knew they were &quot;hot&quot; and
told the police. (Advice here guys don&#039;t try to sell &quot;hot&quot; items to ex-girl
friends).

Soon after the police took him in and were going to press charges on him as
being the mastermind thief.  Until he told them the truth about where he got
the merchandise, implicating The Mentor and the others.

Soon after, the police and FBI had The Mentor, and even though he no longer had
any of the stolen equipment, a warrant and search turned up many other
interesting illegal items. His family being prominent in his town, his dad
wanted him to cooperate fully with the authorities.

Phreaking was basically unheard of by the police in 512 and they wanted to know
how everyone was doing it.  The Mentor&#039;s response was &quot;Blue Boxing&quot;.  His town
is now equipped with 2600 Hertz detectors on the phone lines.  Too bad for
Southwestern Bell that Mentor lied about blue boxing.

Mentor&#039;s dad always had something against The Protestor, if for no other
reason than the fact that he was the one who got Mentor started into phreaking.

The police were interested in the phreak boards, so Mentor&#039;s dad suggested they
call Protestor&#039;s Shack, where The Mentor was a remote sysop.

About this time Mentor had to use the bathroom, or so he told the police.  On
his way to his restroom he stopped in the kitchen and called The Protestor.
He kept it very brief with the one way conversation consisting of roughly these
words, &#039;Get all the illegal shit off your board now! I&#039;ll explain later, just
do it!&#039;

Never the less, they called Protestor&#039;s Shack, only to discover that it was
busy.

Protestor&#039;s Shack went down on February 24, 1986.  At first it was thought that
Kleptic Wizard, a former Extasyy member, would take over the board in 314
(St.Louis, MO).  However, Protestor later decided that maybe it was time that
the board died.  He did add however that he may release his board program as a
ware sometime in the near future.  Most likely to be found on Kleptic Palace AE
first.  He also does plan to one day return to the pirate/phreak/hack world.

              The above information was provided by The Protestor
                         with some parts by The Mentor

The Radio Station BBS
---------------------
Where once stood the famous bulletin board &quot;The Broadway Show&quot;, now stands The
Radio Station. When Broadway Hacker thought he was moving to Washington D.C. he
took down the Broadway Show and gave the line, 718/615-0580, to another who
would run this new bbs.  Since then however Broadway Hacker under the handle
of Program Director is once again running the board, but the remote sysop
Sigmund Fraud is now in total charge. He validates, he hires the subboard
sysops.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Sysop: Program Director
Remote Sysop: Sigmund Fraud &lt;-- Runs the board

Subboard Sysops:

General: Pirate Pete
Sports/Entertainment: White Lotus
Computer Discussion Forum: Lotus
Pirate/Trading: No one (The Cheetah was fired)
Anarchy: No one (The Merc was fired)
Chemical &amp; Explosives: The Wild Phreak (Gray Mouser was fired)
Advanced Hacking and Phreaking: No one (Iron Soldier was fired)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you wish to become a subboard sysop, please leave mail or feedback to
Sigmund Fraud.

The Radio Station is where many LOD members and other old elites hang out.  Its
also among the first to receive new LOD G-Philes.

The Radio Station receives about 15-20 new posts a day.  Their general board is
among the most popular for real world controversial topics.

Program Director has put more time and effort into the debugging and upkeep of
his board than ANY other sysop I&#039;ve ever known.  Some of the nice features on
his board are the message responses which can keep a particular subject going
without interfering with other related subjects.

The Radio Station is a strong supporter of Phrack Newsletter.  Give it a call!

Phoenix Phortress Stings 7                                      415 Under Siege
--------------------------                                      ---------------
On March 5, 1986, the following seven phreaks were arrested in what has come to
be known as the first computer crime &quot;sting&quot; operation.

Captain Hacker
Doctor Bob
Lasertech
The Adventurer
The Highwayman
The Punisher
The Warden

Many of them or other members of Phoenix Phortress belonged to these groups:

High Mountain Hackers
Kaos Inc.
Shadow Brotherhood
The Nihilist Order (Based in Fremont and Sunnyvale)

Of the seven, three were 15 years old; two were 16; one was 17; and one, 19.

Their charges include:

Several misdemeanors
Trafficking in stolen long distance service codes
Trafficking in stolen credit card numbers
Possession of stolen property
Possession of dangerous weapons (a martial arts weapon)
Charging mail-order merchandise to stolen credit card numbers
Selling stolen property
Charging calls internationally to telephone service numbers

         Conviction would mean forfeiture of their computer equipment.

Other phreak boards mentioned include:

Bank Vault (Mainly for credit card numbers and tips on credit card scams)
Phreakers Phortress (Mainly of course for phreak codes and other information)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
After serving search warrants early Wednesday morning on the seven Fremont
residences where the young men live with their parents, police confiscated at
least $12,000 worth of equipment such as computers, modems, monitors, floppy
disks, and manuals, which contained information ranging from how to make a
bomb, to the access codes for the Merrill Lynch and Dean Witter Financial
Services Firm&#039;s corporate computers.

The sysop of Phoenix Phortress was The Revenger, who was supposedly Wally
Richards, a 25 year-old Hayward man who &quot;phreaked back east a little&quot; in New
Jersey.  He took the phone number under the name of Al Davis.  However he was
really Sgt. Daniel Pasquale of the Fremont Police Department.

When he introduced his board to other computer users, he called it the &quot;newest,
coolest, phreak board in town.&quot;  (Editor&#039;s note: The word for today is
ENTRAPMENT!).

Pasquale said he got the idea for the sting operation after a 16-year old
arrested last summer for possession of stolen property &quot;rolled them over
(narced) He told us all about their operation.&quot;

Pasquale used a police department Apple //e computer and equipment, with access
codes and information provided by eight corporations, including Wells Fargo
Bank, Sprint, and MCI.

Pasquale said he received more than 2,500 calls from about 130 regular users
around the country.  The police started to make their first case three days
after the board went up.

&quot;We had taken the unlisted phone number under the name Al Davis,&quot; Pasquale
said. &quot;In six days, these kids had the name on the bulletin board.  I would
have needed a search warrant to get that information.&quot;

The arrests were made after five months of investigation by Dan Pasquale.

                    <p>The <a href="/google-hacking-database">Google Hacking Database (GHDB)</a>
                        is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
                        and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
                        this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
                        information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
                        subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.
                    </p>

                    <p>The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
                        Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
                        Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
                        member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
                        by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
                        recorded at <a href="https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html"
                                       target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEFCON 13</a>. Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
                        to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
                        the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
                        unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
                        Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
                        information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
                        show examples of vulnerable web sites.
                    </p>

                    <p>After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
                        over to <a
                                href="https://www.offensive-security.com/community-projects/"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Offensive Security</a> in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
                        an extension of the <a href="/">Exploit Database</a>. Today, the GHDB includes searches for
                        other online search engines such as <a href="https://www.bing.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bing</a>,
                        and other online repositories like <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>,
                        producing different, yet equally valuable results.
